('69', 'Holt', 'Good evening from Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York. I\'m Lester Holt, anchor of \"NBC Nightly News.\" I want to welcome you to the first presidential debate. The participants tonight are Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. This debate is sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates, a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization. The commission drafted tonight\'s format, and the rules have been agreed to by the campaigns. The 90-minute debate is divided into six segments, each 15 minutes long. We\'ll explore three topic areas tonight: Achieving prosperity; America\'s direction; and securing America. At the start of each segment, I will ask the same lead-off question to both candidates, and they will each have up to two minutes to respond. From that point until the end of the segment, we\'ll have an open discussion. The questions are mine and have not been shared with the commission or the campaigns. The audience here in the room has agreed to remain silent so that we can focus on what the candidates are saying. I will invite you to applaud, however, at this moment, as we welcome the candidates: Democratic nominee for president of the United States, Hillary Clinton, and Republican nominee for president of the United States, Donald J. Trump.', '9/26/16'),

('69', 'Clinton', 'How are you, Donald?', '9/26/16'),

('69', 'Holt', 'Good luck to you.', '9/26/16'),
('69', 'Audience', '(APPLAUSE)', '9/26/16'),
('69', 'Holt', 'Well, I don\'t expect us to cover all the issues of this campaign tonight, but I remind everyone, there are two more presidential debates scheduled. We are going to focus on many of the issues that voters tell us are most important, and we\'re going to press for specifics. I am honored to have this role, but this evening belongs to the candidates and, just as important, to the American people. Candidates, we look forward to hearing you articulate your policies and your positions, as well as your visions and your values. So, let\'s begin. We\'re calling this opening segment \"Achieving Prosperity.\" And central to that is jobs. There are two economic realities in America today. There\'s been a record six straight years of job growth, and new census numbers show incomes have increased at a record rate after years of stagnation. However, income inequality remains significant, and nearly half of Americans are living paycheck to paycheck. Beginning with you, Secretary Clinton, why are you a better choice than your opponent to create the kinds of jobs that will put more money into the pockets of American works?', '9/26/16'),
('69', 'Clinton', 'Well, thank you, Lester, and thanks to Hofstra for hosting us. The central question in this election is really what kind of country we want to be and what kind of future we\'ll build together. Today is my granddaughter\'s second birthday, so I think about this a lot. First, we have to build an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top. That means we need new jobs, good jobs, with rising incomes. I want us to invest in you. I want us to invest in your future. That means jobs in infrastructure, in advanced manufacturing, innovation and technology, clean, renewable energy, and small business, because most of the new jobs will come from small business. We also have to make the economy fairer. That starts with raising the national minimum wage and also guarantee, finally, equal pay for women\'s work.', '9/26/16'),
('69', 'Clinton', 'I also want to see more companies do profit-sharing. If you help create the profits, you should be able to share in them, not just the executives at the top. And I want us to do more to support people who are struggling to balance family and work. I\'ve heard from so many of you about the difficult choices you face and the stresses that you\'re under. So let\'s have paid family leave, earned sick days. Let\'s be sure we have affordable child care and debt-free college. How are we going to do it? We\'re going to do it by having the wealthy pay their fair share and close the corporate loopholes. Finally, we tonight are on the stage together, Donald Trump and I. Donald, it\'s good to be with you. We\'re going to have a debate where we are talking about the important issues facing our country. You have to judge us, who can shoulder the immense, awesome responsibilities of the presidency, who can put into action the plans that will make your life better. I hope that I will be able to earn your vote on November 8th.', '9/26/16'),
('69', 'Holt', 'Secretary Clinton, thank you. Mr. Trump, the same question to you. It\'s about putting money -- more money into the pockets of American workers. You have up to two minutes.', '9/26/16'),
('69', 'Trump', 'Thank you, Lester. Our jobs are fleeing the country. They\'re going to Mexico. They\'re going to many other countries. You look at what China is doing to our country in terms of making our product. They\'re devaluing their currency, and there\'s nobody in our government to fight them. And we have a very good fight. And we have a winning fight. Because they\'re using our country as a piggy bank to rebuild China, and many other countries are doing the same thing. So we\'re losing our good jobs, so many of them. When you look at what\'s happening in Mexico, a friend of mine who builds plants said it\'s the eighth wonder of the world. They\'re building some of the biggest plants anywhere in the world, some of the most sophisticated, some of the best plants. With the United States, as he said, not so much. So Ford is leaving. You see that, their small car division leaving. Thousands of jobs leaving Michigan, leaving Ohio. They\'re all leaving. And we can\'t allow it to happen anymore. As far as child care is concerned and so many other things, I think Hillary and I agree on that. We probably disagree a little bit as to numbers and amounts and what we\'re going to do, but perhaps we\'ll be talking about that later. But we have to stop our jobs from being stolen from us. We have to stop our companies from leaving the United States and, with it, firing all of their people. All you have to do is take a look at Carrier air conditioning in Indianapolis. They left -- fired 1,400 people. They\'re going to Mexico. So many hundreds and hundreds of companies are doing this.', '9/26/16'),
('69', 'Trump', 'We cannot let it happen. Under my plan, I\'ll be reducing taxes tremendously, from 35 percent to 15 percent for companies, small and big businesses. That\'s going to be a job creator like we haven\'t seen since Ronald Reagan. It\'s going to be a beautiful thing to watch. Companies will come. They will build. They will expand. New companies will start. And I look very, very much forward to doing it. We have to renegotiate our trade deals, and we have to stop these countries from stealing our companies and our jobs.', '9/26/16'),
('69', 'Holt', 'Secretary Clinton, would you like to respond?', '9/26/16'),
('69', 'Clinton', 'Well, I think that trade is an important issue. Of course, we are 5 percent of the world\'s population; we have to trade with the other 95 percent. And we need to have smart, fair trade deals. We also, though, need to have a tax system that rewards work and not just financial transactions. And the kind of plan that Donald has put forth would be trickle-down economics all over again. In fact, it would be the most extreme version, the biggest tax cuts for the top percent of the people in this country than we\'ve ever had. I call it trumped-up trickle-down, because that\'s exactly what it would be. That is not how we grow the economy. We just have a different view about what\'s best for growing the economy, how we make investments that will actually produce jobs and rising incomes. I think we come at it from somewhat different perspectives. I understand that. You know, Donald was very fortunate in his life, and that\'s all to his benefit. He started his business with $14 million, borrowed from his father, and he really believes that the more you help wealthy people, the better off we\'ll be and that everything will work out from there. I don\'t buy that. I have a different experience. My father was a small-businessman. He worked really hard. He printed drapery fabrics on long tables, where he pulled out those fabrics and he went down with a silkscreen and dumped the paint in and took the squeegee and kept going. And so what I believe is the more we can do for the middle class, the more we can invest in you, your education, your skills, your future, the better we will be off and the better we\'ll grow. That\'s the kind of economy I want us to see again.', '9/26/16'),
('69', 'Holt', 'Let me follow up with Mr. Trump, if you can. You\'ve talked about creating 25 million jobs, and you\'ve promised to bring back millions of jobs for Americans. How are you going to bring back the industries that have left this country for cheaper labor overseas? How, specifically, are you going to tell American manufacturers that you have to come back?', '9/26/16'),
('69', 'Trump', 'Well, for one thing -- and before we start on that -- my father gave me a very small loan in 1975, and I built it into a company that\'s worth many, many billions of dollars, with some of the greatest assets in the world, and I say that only because that\'s the kind of thinking that our country needs. Our country\'s in deep trouble. We don\'t know what we\'re doing when it comes to devaluations and all of these countries all over the world, especially China. They\'re the best, the best ever at it. What they\'re doing to us is a very, very sad thing. So we have to do that. We have to renegotiate our trade deals. And, Lester, they\'re taking our jobs, they\'re giving incentives, they\'re doing things that, frankly, we don\'t do. Let me give you the example of Mexico. They have a VAT tax. We\'re on a different system. When we sell into Mexico, there\'s a tax. When they sell in -- automatic, 16 percent, approximately. When they sell into us, there\'s no tax. It\'s a defective agreement. It\'s been defective for a long time, many years, but the politicians haven\'t done anything about it. Now, in all fairness to Secretary Clinton -- yes, is that OK? Good. I want you to be very happy. It\'s very important to me. But in all fairness to Secretary Clinton, when she started talking about this, it was really very recently. She\'s been doing this for 30 years. And why hasn\'t she made the agreements better? The NAFTA agreement is defective. Just because of the tax and many other reasons, but just because of the fact...', '9/26/16'),
('69', 'Holt', 'Let me interrupt just a moment, but...', '9/26/16'),
('69', 'Trump', 'Secretary Clinton and others, politicians, should have been doing this for years, not right now, because of the fact that we\'ve created a movement. They should have been doing this for years. What\'s happened to our jobs and our country and our economy generally is -- look, we owe $20 trillion. We cannot do it any longer, Lester.', '9/26/16'),
('69', 'Holt', 'Back to the question, though. How do you bring back -- specifically bring back jobs, American manufacturers? How do you make them bring the jobs back?', '9/26/16'),
('69', 'Trump', 'Well, the first thing you do is don\'t let the jobs leave. The companies are leaving. I could name, I mean, there are thousands of them. They\'re leaving, and they\'re leaving in bigger numbers than ever. And what you do is you say, fine, you want to go to Mexico or some other country, good luck. We wish you a lot of luck. But if you think you\'re going to make your air conditioners or your cars or your cookies or whatever you make and bring them into our country without a tax, you\'re wrong. And once you say you\'re going to have to tax them coming in, and our politicians never do this, because they have special interests and the special interests want those companies to leave, because in many cases, they own the companies. So what I\'m saying is, we can stop them from leaving. We have to stop them from leaving. And that\'s a big, big factor.', '9/26/16'),
('69', 'Holt', 'Let me let Secretary Clinton get in here.', '9/26/16'),
('69', 'Clinton', 'Well, let\'s stop for a second and remember where we were eight years ago. We had the worst financial crisis, the Great Recession, the worst since the 1930s. That was in large part because of tax policies that slashed taxes on the wealthy, failed to invest in the middle class, took their eyes off of Wall Street, and created a perfect storm. In fact, Donald was one of the people who rooted for the housing crisis. He said, back in 2006, \"Gee, I hope it does collapse, because then I can go in and buy some and make some money.\" Well, it did collapse.', '9/26/16'),
('69', 'Trump', 'That\'s called business, by the way.', '9/26/16'),
('69', 'Clinton', 'Nine million people -- nine million people lost their jobs. Five million people lost their homes. And $13 trillion in family wealth was wiped out. Now, we have come back from that abyss. And it has not been easy. So we\'re now on the precipice of having a potentially much better economy, but the last thing we need to do is to go back to the policies that failed us in the first place. Independent experts have looked at what I\'ve proposed and looked at what Donald\'s proposed, and basically they\'ve said this, that if his tax plan, which would blow up the debt by over $5 trillion and would in some instances disadvantage middle-class families compared to the wealthy, were to go into effect, we would lose 3.5 million jobs and maybe have another recession. They\'ve looked at my plans and they\'ve said, OK, if we can do this, and I intend to get it done, we will have 10 million more new jobs, because we will be making investments where we can grow the economy. Take clean energy. Some country is going to be the clean- energy superpower of the 21st century. Donald thinks that climate change is a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese. I think it\'s real.', '9/26/16'),
('69', 'Trump', 'I did not. I did not. I do not say that.', '9/26/16'),
('69', 'Clinton', 'I think science is real.', '9/26/16'),
('69', 'Trump', 'I do not say that.', '9/26/16'),
('69', 'Clinton', 'And I think it\'s important that we grip this and deal with it, both at home and abroad. And here\'s what we can do. We can deploy a half a billion more solar panels. We can have enough clean energy to power every home. We can build a new modern electric grid. That\'s a lot of jobs; that\'s a lot of new economic activity. So I\'ve tried to be very specific about what we can and should do, and I am determined that we\'re going to get the economy really moving again, building on the progress we\'ve made over the last eight years, but never going back to what got us in trouble in the first place.', '9/26/16'),
('69', 'Holt', 'Mr. Trump?', '9/26/16'),
('69', 'Trump', 'She talks about solar panels. We invested in a solar company, our country. That was a disaster. They lost plenty of money on that one. Now, look, I\'m a great believer in all forms of energy, but we\'re putting a lot of people out of work. Our energy policies are a disaster. Our country is losing so much in terms of energy, in terms of paying off our debt. You can\'t do what you\'re looking to do with $20 trillion in debt. The Obama administration, from the time they\'ve come in, is over 230 years\' worth of debt, and he\'s topped it. He\'s doubled it in a course of almost eight years, seven-and-a-half years, to be semi- exact. So I will tell you this. We have to do a much better job at keeping our jobs. And we have to do a much better job at giving companies incentives to build new companies or to expand, because they\'re not doing it. And all you have to do is look at Michigan and look at Ohio and look at all of these places where so many of their jobs and their companies are just leaving, they\'re gone. And, Hillary, I\'d just ask you this. You\'ve been doing this for 30 years. Why are you just thinking about these solutions right now? For 30 years, you\'ve been doing it, and now you\'re just starting to think of solutions.', '9/26/16'),
('69', 'Clinton', 'Well, actually...', '9/26/16'),
('69', 'Trump', 'I will bring -- excuse me. I will bring back jobs. You can\'t bring back jobs.', '9/26/16'),
('69', 'Clinton', 'Well, actually, I have thought about this quite a bit.', '9/26/16'),
('69', 'Trump', 'Yeah, for 30 years.', '9/26/16'),
('69', 'Clinton', 'And I have -- well, not quite that long. I think my husband did a pretty good job in the 1990s. I think a lot about what worked and how we can make it work again...', '9/26/16'),
('69', 'Trump', 'Well, he approved NAFTA...', '9/26/16'),
('69', 'CANDIDATES', '(CROSSTALK)', '9/26/16'),
('69', 'Clinton', '... million new jobs, a balanced budget...', '9/26/16'),
('69', 'Trump', 'He approved NAFTA, which is the single worst trade deal ever approved in this country.', '9/26/16'),
('69', 'Clinton', 'Incomes went up for everybody. Manufacturing jobs went up also in the 1990s, if we\'re actually going to look at the facts. When I was in the Senate, I had a number of trade deals that came before me, and I held them all to the same test. Will they create jobs in America? Will they raise incomes in America? And are they good for our national security? Some of them I voted for. The biggest one, a multinational one known as CAFTA, I voted against. And because I hold the same standards as I look at all of these trade deals. But let\'s not assume that trade is the only challenge we have in the economy. I think it is a part of it, and I\'ve said what I\'m going to do. I\'m going to have a special prosecutor. We\'re going to enforce the trade deals we have, and we\'re going to hold people accountable. When I was secretary of state, we actually increased American exports globally 30 percent. We increased them to China 50 percent. So I know how to really work to get new jobs and to get exports that helped to create more new jobs.', '9/26/16'),
('69', 'Holt', 'Very quickly...', '9/26/16'),
('69', 'Trump', 'But you haven\'t done it in 30 years or 26 years or any number you want to...', '9/26/16'),
('69', 'Clinton', 'Well, I\'ve been a senator, Donald...', '9/26/16'),
('69', 'Trump', 'You haven\'t done it. You haven\'t done it.', '9/26/16'),
('69', 'Clinton', 'And I have been a secretary of state...', '9/26/16'),
('69', 'Trump', 'Excuse me.', '9/26/16'),
('69', 'Clinton', 'And I have done a lot...', '9/26/16'),
('69', 'Trump', 'Your husband signed NAFTA, which was one of the worst things that ever happened to the manufacturing industry.', '9/26/16'),
('69', 'Clinton', 'Well, that\'s your opinion. That is your opinion.', '9/26/16'),
('69', 'Trump', 'You go to New England, you go to Ohio, Pennsylvania, you go anywhere you want, Secretary Clinton, and you will see devastation where manufacture is down 30, 40, sometimes 50 percent. NAFTA is the worst trade deal maybe ever signed anywhere, but certainly ever signed in this country. And now you want to approve Trans-Pacific Partnership. You were totally in favor of it. Then you heard what I was saying, how bad it is, and you said, I can\'t win that debate. But you know that if you did win, you would approve that, and that will be almost as bad as NAFTA. Nothing will ever top NAFTA.', '9/26/16'),
('69', 'Clinton', 'Well, that is just not accurate. I was against it once it was finally negotiated and the terms were laid out. I wrote about that in...', '9/26/16'),
('69', 'Trump', 'You called it the gold standard.', '9/26/16'),
('69', 'CANDIDATES', '(CROSSTALK)', '9/26/16'),
('69', 'Trump', 'You called it the gold standard of trade deals. You said it\'s the finest deal you\'ve ever seen.', '9/26/16'),
('69', 'Clinton', 'No.', '9/26/16'),
('69', 'Trump', 'And then you heard what I said about it, and all of a sudden you were against it.', '9/26/16'),
('69', 'Clinton', 'Well, Donald, I know you live in your own reality, but that is not the facts. The facts are -- I did say I hoped it would be a good deal, but when it was negotiated...', '9/26/16'),
('69', 'Trump', 'Not.', '9/26/16'),
('69', 'Clinton', '... which I was not responsible for, I concluded it wasn\'t. I wrote about that in my book...', '9/26/16'),
('69', 'Trump', 'So is it President Obama\'s fault?', '9/26/16'),
('69', 'Clinton', '... before you even announced.', '9/26/16'),
('69', 'Trump', 'Is it President Obama\'s fault?', '9/26/16'),
('69', 'Clinton', 'Look, there are differences...', '9/26/16'),
('69', 'Trump', 'Secretary, is it President Obama\'s fault?', '9/26/16'),
('69', 'Clinton', 'There are...', '9/26/16'),
('69', 'Trump', 'Because he\'s pushing it.', '9/26/16'),
('69', 'Clinton', 'There are different views about what\'s good for our country, our economy, and our leadership in the world. And I think it\'s important to look at what we need to do to get the economy going again. That\'s why I said new jobs with rising incomes, investments, not in more tax cuts that would add $5 trillion to the debt.', '9/26/16'),
('69', 'Trump', 'But you have no plan.', '9/26/16'),
('69', 'Clinton', 'But in -- oh, but I do.', '9/26/16'),
('69', 'Trump', 'Secretary, you have no plan.', '9/26/16'),
('69', 'Clinton', 'In fact, I have written a book about it. It\'s called \"Stronger Together.\" You can pick it up tomorrow at a bookstore...', '9/26/16'),

('69', 'Holt', 'We\'re going to move to...', '9/26/16'),
('69', 'Clinton', 'But it\'s because I see this -- we need to have strong growth, fair growth, sustained growth. We also have to look at how we help families balance the responsibilities at home and the responsibilities at business. So we have a very robust set of plans. And people have looked at both of our plans, have concluded that mine would create 10 million jobs and yours would lose us 3.5 million jobs, and explode the debt which would have a recession.', '9/26/16'),
('69', 'Trump', 'You are going to approve one of the biggest tax cuts in history. You are going to approve one of the biggest tax increases in history. You are going to drive business out. Your regulations are a disaster, and you\'re going to increase regulations all over the place. And by the way, my tax cut is the biggest since Ronald Reagan. I\'m very proud of it. It will create tremendous numbers of new jobs. But regulations, you are going to regulate these businesses out of existence. When I go around -- Lester, I tell you this, I\'ve been all over. And when I go around, despite the tax cut, the thing -- the things that business as in people like the most is the fact that I\'m cutting regulation. You have regulations on top of regulations, and new companies cannot form and old companies are going out of business. And you want to increase the regulations and make them even worse. I\'m going to cut regulations. I\'m going to cut taxes big league, and you\'re going to raise taxes big league, end of story.', '9/26/16'),
('69', 'Holt', 'Let me get you to pause right there, because we\'re going to move into -- we\'re going to move into the next segment. We\'re going to talk taxes...', '9/26/16'),

('69', 'Clinton', '... would not add a penny to the debt, and your plans would add $5 trillion to the debt. What I have proposed would cut regulations and streamline them for small businesses. What I have proposed would be paid for by raising taxes on the wealthy, because they have made all the gains in the economy. And I think it\'s time that the wealthy and corporations paid their fair share to support this country.', '9/26/16'),

('69', 'Holt', 'OK, you are unpacking a lot here. And we\'re still on the issue of achieving prosperity. And I want to talk about taxes. The fundamental difference between the two of you concerns the wealthy. Secretary Clinton, you\'re calling for a tax increase on the wealthiest Americans. I\'d like you to further defend that. And, Mr. Trump, you\'re calling for tax cuts for the wealthy. I\'d like you to defend that. And this next two-minute answer goes to you, Mr. Trump.', '9/26/16'),
('69', 'Trump', 'Well, I\'m really calling for major jobs, because the wealthy are going create tremendous jobs. They\'re going to expand their companies. They\'re going to do a tremendous job. I\'m getting rid of the carried interest provision. And if you really look, it\'s not a tax -- it\'s really not a great thing for the wealthy. It\'s a great thing for the middle class. It\'s a great thing for companies to expand. And when these people are going to put billions and billions of dollars into companies, and when they\'re going to bring $2.5 trillion back from overseas, where they can\'t bring the money back, because politicians like Secretary Clinton won\'t allow them to bring the money back, because the taxes are so onerous, and the bureaucratic red tape, so what -- is so bad. So what they\'re doing is they\'re leaving our country, and they\'re, believe it or not, leaving because taxes are too high and because some of them have lots of money outside of our country. And instead of bringing it back and putting the money to work, because they can\'t work out a deal to -- and everybody agrees it should be brought back. Instead of that, they\'re leaving our country to get their money, because they can\'t bring their money back into our country, because of bureaucratic red tape, because they can\'t get together. Because we have -- we have a president that can\'t sit them around a table and get them to approve something. And here\'s the thing. Republicans and Democrats agree that this should be done, $2.5 trillion. I happen to think it\'s double that. It\'s probably $5 trillion that we can\'t bring into our country, Lester. And with a little leadership, you\'d get it in here very quickly, and it could be put to use on the inner cities and lots of other things, and it would be beautiful. But we have no leadership. And honestly, that starts with Secretary Clinton.', '9/26/16'),

And the only thing that looks good is the stock market, but if you raise interest rates even a little bit, that\'s going to come crashing down. We are in a big, fat, ugly bubble. And we better be awfully careful. And we have a Fed that\'s doing political things. This Janet Yellen of the Fed. The Fed is doing political -- by keeping the interest rates at this level. And believe me: The day Obama goes off, and he leaves, and goes out to the golf course for the rest of his life to play golf, when they raise interest rates, you\'re going to see some very bad things happen, because the Fed is not doing their job. The Fed is being more political than Secretary Clinton.', '9/26/16'),

If you would have told me I was going to make that 15 or 20 years ago, I would have been very surprised. But that\'s the kind of thinking that our country needs.

I get audited by the IRS. But other people don\'t. I will say this. We have a situation in this country that has to be taken care of.

You can go and see nearly, I think, 39, 40 years of our tax returns, but everyone has done it. We know the IRS has made clear there is no prohibition on releasing it when you\'re under audit. So you\'ve got to ask yourself, why won\'t he release his tax returns? And I think there may be a couple of reasons. First, maybe he\'s not as rich as he says he is. Second, maybe he\'s not as charitable as he claims to be.', '9/26/16'),
('69', 'Clinton', 'Third, we don\'t know all of his business dealings, but we have been told through investigative reporting that he owes about $650 million to Wall Street and foreign banks. Or maybe he doesn\'t want the American people, all of you watching tonight, to know that he\'s paid nothing in federal taxes, because the only years that anybody\'s ever seen were a couple of years when he had to turn them over to state authorities when he was trying to get a casino license, and they showed he didn\'t pay any federal income tax.', '9/26/16'),

And I think probably he\'s not all that enthusiastic about having the rest of our country see what the real reasons are, because it must be something really important, even terrible, that he\'s trying to hide. And the financial disclosure statements, they don\'t give you the tax rate. They don\'t give you all the details that tax returns would. And it just seems to me that this is something that the American people deserve to see. And I have no reason to believe that he\'s ever going to release his tax returns, because there\'s something he\'s hiding. And we\'ll guess. We\'ll keep guessing at what it might be that he\'s hiding. But I think the question is, were he ever to get near the White House, what would be those conflicts? Who does he owe money to? Well, he owes you the answers to that, and he should provide them.', '9/26/16'),

('69', 'Trump', 'That was more than a mistake. That was done purposely. OK? That was not a mistake. That was done purposely. When you have your staff taking the Fifth Amendment, taking the Fifth so they\'re not prosecuted, when you have the man that set up the illegal server taking the Fifth, I think it\'s disgraceful. And believe me, this country thinks it\'s -- really thinks it\'s disgraceful, also. As far as my tax returns, you don\'t learn that much from tax returns. That I can tell you. You learn a lot from financial disclosure. And you should go down and take a look at that. The other thing, I\'m extremely underleveraged. The report that said $650 -- which, by the way, a lot of friends of mine that know my business say, boy, that\'s really not a lot of money. It\'s not a lot of money relative to what I had. The buildings that were in question, they said in the same report, which was -- actually, it wasn\'t even a bad story, to be honest with you, but the buildings are worth $3.9 billion. And the $650 isn\'t even on that. But it\'s not $650. It\'s much less than that. But I could give you a list of banks, I would -- if that would help you, I would give you a list of banks. These are very fine institutions, very fine banks. I could do that very quickly. I am very underleveraged. I have a great company. I have a tremendous income. And the reason I say that is not in a braggadocios way. It\'s because it\'s about time that this country had somebody running it that has an idea about money. When we have $20 trillion in debt, and our country\'s a mess, you know, it\'s one thing to have $20 trillion in debt and our roads are good and our bridges are good and everything\'s in great shape, our airports. Our airports are like from a third world country. You land at LaGuardia, you land at Kennedy, you land at LAX, you land at Newark, and you come in from Dubai and Qatar and you see these incredible -- you come in from China, you see these incredible airports, and you land -- we\'ve become a third world country. So the worst of all things has happened. We owe $20 trillion, and we\'re a mess. We haven\'t even started. And we\'ve spent $6 trillion in the Middle East, according to a report that I just saw. Whether it\'s 6 or 5, but it looks like it\'s 6, $6 trillion in the Middle East, we could have rebuilt our country twice. And it\'s really a shame. And it\'s politicians like Secretary Clinton that have caused this problem. Our country has tremendous problems. We\'re a debtor nation. We\'re a serious debtor nation. And we have a country that needs new roads, new tunnels, new bridges, new airports, new schools, new hospitals. And we don\'t have the money, because it\'s been squandered on so many of your ideas.', '9/26/16'),

He provided a good middle-class life for us, but the people he worked for, he expected the bargain to be kept on both sides. And when we talk about your business, you\'ve taken business bankruptcy six times. There are a lot of great businesspeople that have never taken bankruptcy once. You call yourself the King of Debt. You talk about leverage. You even at one time suggested that you would try to negotiate down the national debt of the United States.', '9/26/16'),

Some of the greatest assets anywhere in the world, real estate assets anywhere in the world, beyond the United States, in Europe, lots of different places. It\'s an unbelievable company. But on occasion, four times, we used certain laws that are there. And when Secretary Clinton talks about people that didn\'t get paid, first of all, they did get paid a lot, but taken advantage of the laws of the nation. Now, if you want to change the laws, you\'ve been there a long time, change the laws. But I take advantage of the laws of the nation because I\'m running a company. My obligation right now is to do well for myself, my family, my employees, for my companies. And that\'s what I do. But what she doesn\'t say is that tens of thousands of people that are unbelievably happy and that love me. I\'ll give you an example. We\'re just opening up on Pennsylvania Avenue right next to the White House, so if I don\'t get there one way, I\'m going to get to Pennsylvania Avenue another. But we\'re opening the Old Post Office. Under budget, ahead of schedule, saved tremendous money. I\'m a year ahead of schedule. And that\'s what this country should be doing. We build roads and they cost two and three and four times what they\'re supposed to cost. We buy products for our military and they come in at costs that are so far above what they were supposed to be, because we don\'t have people that know what they\'re doing. When we look at the budget, the budget is bad to a large extent because we have people that have no idea as to what to do and how to buy. The Trump International is way under budget and way ahead of schedule. And we should be able to do that for our country.', '9/26/16'),
('69', 'Holt', 'Well, we\'re well behind schedule, so I want to move to our next segment. We move into our next segment talking about America\'s direction. And let\'s start by talking about race. The share of Americans who say race relations are bad in this country is the highest it\'s been in decades, much of it amplified by shootings of African-Americans by police, as we\'ve seen recently in Charlotte and Tulsa. Race has been a big issue in this campaign, and one of you is going to have to bridge a very wide and bitter gap. So how do you heal the divide? Secretary Clinton, you get two minutes on this.', '9/26/16'),
('69', 'Clinton', 'Well, you\'re right. Race remains a significant challenge in our country. Unfortunately, race still determines too much, often determines where people live, determines what kind of education in their public schools they can get, and, yes, it determines how they\'re treated in the criminal justice system. We\'ve just seen those two tragic examples in both Tulsa and Charlotte. And we\'ve got to do several things at the same time. We have to restore trust between communities and the police. We have to work to make sure that our police are using the best training, the best techniques, that they\'re well prepared to use force only when necessary. Everyone should be respected by the law, and everyone should respect the law.', '9/26/16'),
('69', 'Clinton', 'Right now, that\'s not the case in a lot of our neighborhoods. So I have, ever since the first day of my campaign, called for criminal justice reform. I\'ve laid out a platform that I think would begin to remedy some of the problems we have in the criminal justice system. But we also have to recognize, in addition to the challenges that we face with policing, there are so many good, brave police officers who equally want reform. So we have to bring communities together in order to begin working on that as a mutual goal. And we\'ve got to get guns out of the hands of people who should not have them. The gun epidemic is the leading cause of death of young African- American men, more than the next nine causes put together. So we have to do two things, as I said. We have to restore trust. We have to work with the police. We have to make sure they respect the communities and the communities respect them. And we have to tackle the plague of gun violence, which is a big contributor to a lot of the problems that we\'re seeing today.', '9/26/16'),
('69', 'Holt', 'All right, Mr. Trump, you have two minutes. How do you heal the divide?', '9/26/16'),
('69', 'Trump', 'Well, first of all, Secretary Clinton doesn\'t want to use a couple of words, and that\'s law and order. And we need law and order. If we don\'t have it, we\'re not going to have a country. And when I look at what\'s going on in Charlotte, a city I love, a city where I have investments, when I look at what\'s going on throughout various parts of our country, whether it\'s -- I mean, I can just keep naming them all day long -- we need law and order in our country. I just got today the, as you know, the endorsement of the Fraternal Order of Police, we just -- just came in. We have endorsements from, I think, almost every police group, very -- I mean, a large percentage of them in the United States. We have a situation where we have our inner cities, African- Americans, Hispanics are living in he\'ll because it\'s so dangerous. You walk down the street, you get shot. In Chicago, they\'ve had thousands of shootings, thousands since January 1st. Thousands of shootings. And I\'m saying, where is this? Is this a war-torn country? What are we doing? And we have to stop the violence. We have to bring back law and order. In a place like Chicago, where thousands of people have been killed, thousands over the last number of years, in fact, almost 4,000 have been killed since Barack Obama became president, over -- almost 4,000 people in Chicago have been killed. We have to bring back law and order. Now, whether or not in a place like Chicago you do stop and frisk, which worked very well, Mayor Giuliani is here, worked very well in New York. It brought the crime rate way down. But you take the gun away from criminals that shouldn\'t be having it. We have gangs roaming the street. And in many cases, they\'re illegally here, illegal immigrants. And they have guns. And they shoot people. And we have to be very strong. And we have to be very vigilant. We have to be -- we have to know what we\'re doing. Right now, our police, in many cases, are afraid to do anything. We have to protect our inner cities, because African-American communities are being decimated by crime, decimated.', '9/26/16');

('69', 'Clinton', 'You know, the vibrancy of the black church, the black businesses that employ so many people, the opportunities that so many families are working to provide for their kids. There\'s a lot that we should be proud of and we should be supporting and lifting up. But we do always have to make sure we keep people safe. There are the right ways of doing it, and then there are ways that are ineffective. Stop-and-frisk was found to be unconstitutional and, in part, because it was ineffective. It did not do what it needed to do. Now, I believe in community policing. And, in fact, violent crime is one-half of what it was in 1991. Property crime is down 40 percent. We just don\'t want to see it creep back up. We\'ve had 25 years of very good cooperation. But there were some problems, some unintended consequences. Too many young African-American and Latino men ended up in jail for nonviolent offenses. And it\'s just a fact that if you\'re a young African-American man and you do the same thing as a young white man, you are more likely to be arrested, charged, convicted, and incarcerated. So we\'ve got to address the systemic racism in our criminal justice system. We cannot just say law and order. We have to say -- we have to come forward with a plan that is going to divert people from the criminal justice system, deal with mandatory minimum sentences, which have put too many people away for too long for doing too little. We need to have more second chance programs. I\'m glad that we\'re ending private prisons in the federal system; I want to see them ended in the state system. You shouldn\'t have a profit motivation to fill prison cells with young Americans. So there are some positive ways we can work on this. And I believe strongly that commonsense gun safety measures would assist us. Right now -- and this is something Donald has supported, along with the gun lobby -- right now, we\'ve got too many military- style weapons on the streets. In a lot of places, our police are outgunned. We need comprehensive background checks, and we need to keep guns out of the hands of those who will do harm. And we finally need to pass a prohibition on anyone who\'s on the terrorist watch list from being able to buy a gun in our country. If you\'re too dangerous to fly, you are too dangerous to buy a gun. So there are things we can do, and we ought to do it in a bipartisan way.', '9/26/16'),

But when it comes to policing, since it can have literally fatal consequences, I have said, in my first budget, we would put money into that budget to help us deal with implicit bias by retraining a lot of our police officers. I\'ve met with a group of very distinguished, experienced police chiefs a few weeks ago. They admit it\'s an issue. They\'ve got a lot of concerns.

But I think we have to look very strongly at no-fly lists and watch lists. And when people are on there, even if they shouldn\'t be on there, we\'ll help them, we\'ll help them legally, we\'ll help them get off. But I tend to agree with that quite strongly. I do want to bring up the fact that you were the one that brought up the words super-predator about young black youth. And that\'s a term that I think was a -- it\'s -- it\'s been horribly met, as you know. I think you\'ve apologized for it. But I think it was a terrible thing to say. And when it comes to stop-and-frisk, you know, you\'re talking about takes guns away. Well, I\'m talking about taking guns away from gangs and people that use them. And I don\'t think -- I really don\'t think you disagree with me on this, if you want to know the truth. I think maybe there\'s a political reason why you can\'t say it, but I really don\'t believe -- in New York City, stop-and-frisk, we had 2,200 murders, and stop-and-frisk brought it down to 500 murders. Five hundred murders is a lot of murders. It\'s hard to believe, 500 is like supposed to be good? But we went from 2,200 to 500. And it was continued on by Mayor Bloomberg. And it was terminated by current mayor. But stop-and- frisk had a tremendous impact on the safety of New York City. Tremendous beyond belief. So when you say it has no impact, it really did. It had a very, very big impact.', '9/26/16'),

And other communities need to come together to do what will work, as well. Look, one murder is too many. But it is important that we learn about what has been effective. And not go to things that sound good that really did not have the kind of impact that we would want. Who disagrees with keeping neighborhoods safe? But let\'s also add, no one should disagree about respecting the rights of young men who live in those neighborhoods. And so we need to do a better job of working, again, with the communities, faith communities, business communities, as well as the police to try to deal with this problem.', '9/26/16'),

But it can\'t be dismissed that easily. He has really started his political activity based on this racist lie that our first black president was not an American citizen. There was absolutely no evidence for it, but he persisted, he persisted year after year, because some of his supporters, people that he was trying to bring into his fold, apparently believed it or wanted to believe it. But, remember, Donald started his career back in 1973 being sued by the Justice Department for racial discrimination because he would not rent apartments in one of his developments to African-Americans, and he made sure that the people who worked for him understood that was the policy. He actually was sued twice by the Justice Department. So he has a long record of engaging in racist behavior. And the birther lie was a very hurtful one. You know, Barack Obama is a man of great dignity. And I could tell how much it bothered him and annoyed him that this was being touted and used against him. But I like to remember what Michelle Obama said in her amazing speech at our Democratic National Convention: When they go low, we go high.

And I watched the way you talk now about how lovely everything is and how wonderful you are. It doesn\'t work that way. You were after him, you were trying to -- you even sent out or your campaign sent out pictures of him in a certain garb, very famous pictures. I don\'t think you can deny that. But just last week, your campaign manager said it was true. So when you tried to act holier than thou, it really doesn\'t work. It really doesn\'t. Now, as far as the lawsuit, yes, when I was very young, I went into my father\'s company, had a real estate company in Brooklyn and Queens, and we, along with many, many other companies throughout the country -- it was a federal lawsuit -- were sued. We settled the suit with zero -- with no admission of guilt. It was very easy to do.', '9/26/16'),

Because I settled that lawsuit with no admission of guilt, but that was a lawsuit brought against many real estate firms, and it\'s just one of those things. I\'ll go one step further. In Palm Beach, Florida, tough community, a brilliant community, a wealthy community, probably the wealthiest community there is in the world, I opened a club, and really got great credit for it. No discrimination against African- Americans, against Muslims, against anybody. And it\'s a tremendously successful club. And I\'m so glad I did it. And I have been given great credit for what I did.

There are the independent hacking groups that do it mostly for commercial reasons to try to steal information that they can use to make money. But increasingly, we are seeing cyber attacks coming from states, organs of states. The most recent and troubling of these has been Russia. There\'s no doubt now that Russia has used cyber attacks against all kinds of organizations in our country, and I am deeply concerned about this.

And we recently have learned that, you know, that this is one of their preferred methods of trying to wreak havoc and collect information. We need to make it very clear -- whether it\'s Russia, China, Iran or anybody else -- the United States has much greater capacity. And we are not going to sit idly by and permit state actors to go after our information, our private-sector information or our public-sector information. And we\'re going to have to make it clear that we don\'t want to use the kinds of tools that we have. We don\'t want to engage in a different kind of warfare. But we will defend the citizens of this country. And the Russians need to understand that. I think they\'ve been treating it as almost a probing, how far would we go, how much would we do. And that\'s why I was so -- I was so shocked when Donald publicly invited Putin to hack into Americans. That is just unacceptable.

That just happened, and many more are coming. And I\'m very proud of it. In addition, I was just endorsed by ICE. They\'ve never endorsed anybody before on immigration. I was just endorsed by ICE. I was just recently endorsed -- 16,500 Border Patrol agents. So when Secretary Clinton talks about this, I mean, I\'ll take the admirals and I\'ll take the generals any day over the political hacks that I see that have led our country so brilliantly over the last 10 years with their knowledge. OK? Because look at the mess that we\'re in. Look at the mess that we\'re in. As far as the cyber, I agree to parts of what Secretary Clinton said. We should be better than anybody else, and perhaps we\'re not. I don\'t think anybody knows it was Russia that broke into the DNC. She\'s saying Russia, Russia, Russia, but I don\'t -- maybe it was. I mean, it could be Russia, but it could also be China. It could also be lots of other people. It also could be somebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds, OK?', '9/26/16'),

Look what happened to her. But Bernie Sanders was taken advantage of. That\'s what we learned. Now, whether that was Russia, whether that was China, whether it was another country, we don\'t know, because the truth is, under President Obama we\'ve lost control of things that we used to have control over. We came in with the Internet, we came up with the Internet, and I think Secretary Clinton and myself would agree very much, when you look at what ISIS is doing with the Internet, they\'re beating us at our own game. ISIS. So we have to get very, very tough on cyber and cyber warfare. It is -- it is a huge problem. I have a son. He\'s 10 years old. He has computers. He is so good with these computers, it\'s unbelievable. The security aspect of cyber is very, very tough. And maybe it\'s hardly doable. But I will say, we are not doing the job we should be doing. But that\'s true throughout our whole governmental society. We have so many things that we have to do better, Lester, and certainly cyber is one of them.', '9/26/16'),
('69', 'Holt', 'Secretary Clinton?', '9/26/16'),
('69', 'Clinton', 'Well, I think there are a number of issues that we should be addressing. I have put forth a plan to defeat ISIS. It does involve going after them online. I think we need to do much more with our tech companies to prevent ISIS and their operatives from being able to use the Internet to radicalize, even direct people in our country and Europe and elsewhere. But we also have to intensify our air strikes against ISIS and eventually support our Arab and Kurdish partners to be able to actually take out ISIS in Raqqa, end their claim of being a Caliphate. We\'re making progress. Our military is assisting in Iraq. And we\'re hoping that within the year we\'ll be able to push ISIS out of Iraq and then, you know, really squeeze them in Syria. But we have to be cognizant of the fact that they\'ve had foreign fighters coming to volunteer for them, foreign money, foreign weapons, so we have to make this the top priority. And I would also do everything possible to take out their leadership. I was involved in a number of efforts to take out Al Qaida leadership when I was secretary of state, including, of course, taking out bin Laden. And I think we need to go after Baghdadi, as well, make that one of our organizing principles. Because we\'ve got to defeat ISIS, and we\'ve got to do everything we can to disrupt their propaganda efforts online.', '9/26/16'),

I\'ll ask this to both of you. Tell us specifically how you would prevent homegrown attacks by American citizens, Mr. Trump?', '9/26/16'),
('69', 'Trump', 'Well, first I have to say one thing, very important. Secretary Clinton is talking about taking out ISIS. \"We will take out ISIS.\" Well, President Obama and Secretary Clinton created a vacuum the way they got out of Iraq, because they got out -- what, they shouldn\'t have been in, but once they got in, the way they got out was a disaster. And ISIS was formed. So she talks about taking them out. She\'s been doing it a long time. She\'s been trying to take them out for a long time. But they wouldn\'t have even been formed if they left some troops behind, like 10,000 or maybe something more than that. And then you wouldn\'t have had them. Or, as I\'ve been saying for a long time, and I think you\'ll agree, because I said it to you once, had we taken the oil -- and we should have taken the oil -- ISIS would not have been able to form either, because the oil was their primary source of income. And now they have the oil all over the place, including the oil -- a lot of the oil in Libya, which was another one of her disasters.', '9/26/16'),

('69', 'Clinton', 'He actually advocated for the actions we took in Libya and urged that Gadhafi be taken out, after actually doing some business with him one time.', '9/26/16'),
('69', 'Clinton', 'But the larger point -- and he says this constantly -- is George W. Bush made the agreement about when American troops would leave Iraq, not Barack Obama. And the only way that American troops could have stayed in Iraq is to get an agreement from the then-Iraqi government that would have protected our troops, and the Iraqi government would not give that. But let\'s talk about the question you asked, Lester. The question you asked is, what do we do here in the United States? That\'s the most important part of this. How do we prevent attacks? How do we protect our people? And I think we\'ve got to have an intelligence surge, where we are looking for every scrap of information. I was so proud of law enforcement in New York, in Minnesota, in New Jersey. You know, they responded so quickly, so professionally to the attacks that occurred by Rahami. And they brought him down. And we may find out more information because he is still alive, which may prove to be an intelligence benefit. So we\'ve got to do everything we can to vacuum up intelligence from Europe, from the Middle East. That means we\'ve got to work more closely with our allies, and that\'s something that Donald has been very dismissive of. We\'re working with NATO, the longest military alliance in the history of the world, to really turn our attention to terrorism. We\'re working with our friends in the Middle East, many of which, as you know, are Muslim majority nations. Donald has consistently insulted Muslims abroad, Muslims at home, when we need to be cooperating with Muslim nations and with the American Muslim community. They\'re on the front lines. They can provide information to us that we might not get anywhere else. They need to have close working cooperation with law enforcement in these communities, not be alienated and pushed away as some of Donald\'s rhetoric, unfortunately, has led to.', '9/26/16'),

You look at the Middle East, it\'s a total mess. Under your direction, to a large extent. But you look at the Middle East, you started the Iran deal, that\'s another beauty where you have a country that was ready to fall, I mean, they were doing so badly. They were choking on the sanctions. And now they\'re going to be actually probably a major power at some point pretty soon, the way they\'re going. But when you look at NATO, I was asked on a major show, what do you think of NATO? And you have to understand, I\'m a businessperson. I did really well. But I have common sense. And I said, well, I\'ll tell you. I haven\'t given lots of thought to NATO. But two things. Number one, the 28 countries of NATO, many of them aren\'t paying their fair share. Number two -- and that bothers me, because we should be asking -- we\'re defending them, and they should at least be paying us what they\'re supposed to be paying by treaty and contract. And, number two, I said, and very strongly, NATO could be obsolete, because -- and I was very strong on this, and it was actually covered very accurately in the New York Times, which is unusual for the New York Times, to be honest -- but I said, they do not focus on terror. And I was very strong. And I said it numerous times. And about four months ago, I read on the front page of the Wall Street Journal that NATO is opening up a major terror division. And I think that\'s great. And I think we should get -- because we pay approximately 73 percent of the cost of NATO. It\'s a lot of money to protect other people. But I\'m all for NATO. But I said they have to focus on terror, also. And they\'re going to do that. And that was -- believe me -- I\'m sure I\'m not going to get credit for it -- but that was largely because of what I was saying and my criticism of NATO. I think we have to get NATO to go into the Middle East with us, in addition to surrounding nations, and we have to knock the hell out of ISIS, and we have to do it fast, when ISIS formed in this vacuum created by Barack Obama and Secretary Clinton.

('69', 'Clinton', 'Let\'s talk about two important issues that were briefly mentioned by Donald, first, NATO. You know, NATO as a military alliance has something called Article 5, and basically it says this: An attack on one is an attack on all. And you know the only time it\'s ever been invoked? After 9/11, when the 28 nations of NATO said that they would go to Afghanistan with us to fight terrorism, something that they still are doing by our side. With respect to Iran, when I became secretary of state, Iran was weeks away from having enough nuclear material to form a bomb. They had mastered the nuclear fuel cycle under the Bush administration. They had built covert facilities. They had stocked them with centrifuges that were whirling away. And we had sanctioned them. I voted for every sanction against Iran when I was in the Senate, but it wasn\'t enough. So I spent a year-and-a-half putting together a coalition that included Russia and China to impose the toughest sanctions on Iran. And we did drive them to the negotiating table. And my successor, John Kerry, and President Obama got a deal that put a lid on Iran\'s nuclear program without firing a single shot. That\'s diplomacy. That\'s coalition-building. That\'s working with other nations. The other day, I saw Donald saying that there were some Iranian sailors on a ship in the waters off of Iran, and they were taunting American sailors who were on a nearby ship. He said, you know, if they taunted our sailors, I\'d blow them out of the water and start another war. That\'s not good judgment.', '9/26/16'),
('69', 'Trump', 'That would not start a war.', '9/26/16'),
('69', 'Clinton', 'That is not the right temperament to be commander-in- chief, to be taunted. And the worst part...', '9/26/16'),
('69', 'Trump', 'No, they were taunting us.', '9/26/16'),
('69', 'Clinton', '... of what we heard Donald say has been about nuclear weapons. He has said repeatedly that he didn\'t care if other nations got nuclear weapons, Japan, South Korea, even Saudi Arabia. It has been the policy of the United States, Democrats and Republicans, to do everything we could to reduce the proliferation of nuclear weapons. He even said, well, you know, if there were nuclear war in East Asia, well, you know, that\'s fine...', '9/26/16'),
('69', 'Trump', 'Wrong.', '9/26/16'),
('69', 'Clinton', '... have a good time, folks.', '9/26/16'),
('69', 'Trump', 'It\'s lies.', '9/26/16'),
('69', 'Clinton', 'And, in fact, his cavalier attitude about nuclear weapons is so deeply troubling. That is the number-one threat we face in the world. And it becomes particularly threatening if terrorists ever get their hands on any nuclear material. So a man who can be provoked by a tweet should not have his fingers anywhere near the nuclear codes, as far as I think anyone with any sense about this should be concerned.', '9/26/16'),
('69', 'Trump', 'That line\'s getting a little bit old, I must say. I would like to...', '9/26/16'),
('69', 'Clinton', 'It\'s a good one, though. It well describes the problem.', '9/26/16'),

('69', 'Trump', 'It\'s not an accurate one at all. It\'s not an accurate one. So I just want to give a lot of things -- and just to respond. I agree with her on one thing. The single greatest problem the world has is nuclear armament, nuclear weapons, not global warming, like you think and your -- your president thinks. Nuclear is the single greatest threat. Just to go down the list, we defend Japan, we defend Germany, we defend South Korea, we defend Saudi Arabia, we defend countries. They do not pay us. But they should be paying us, because we are providing tremendous service and we\'re losing a fortune. That\'s why we\'re losing -- we\'re losing -- we lose on everything. I say, who makes these -- we lose on everything. All I said, that it\'s very possible that if they don\'t pay a fair share, because this isn\'t 40 years ago where we could do what we\'re doing. We can\'t defend Japan, a behemoth, selling us cars by the million...', '9/26/16'),
('69', 'Holt', 'We need to move on.', '9/26/16'),
('69', 'Trump', 'Well, wait, but it\'s very important. All I said was, they may have to defend themselves or they have to help us out. We\'re a country that owes $20 trillion. They have to help us out.', '9/26/16'),
('69', 'Holt', 'Our last...', '9/26/16'),
('69', 'Trump', 'As far as the nuclear is concerned, I agree. It is the single greatest threat that this country has.', '9/26/16'),
('69', 'Holt', 'Which leads to my next question, as we enter our last segment here (inaudible) the subject of securing America. On nuclear weapons, President Obama reportedly considered changing the nation\'s longstanding policy on first use. Do you support the current policy? Mr. Trump, you have two minutes on that.', '9/26/16'),
('69', 'Trump', 'Well, I have to say that, you know, for what Secretary Clinton was saying about nuclear with Russia, she\'s very cavalier in the way she talks about various countries. But Russia has been expanding their -- they have a much newer capability than we do. We have not been updating from the new standpoint. I looked the other night. I was seeing B-52s, they\'re old enough that your father, your grandfather could be flying them. We are not -- we are not keeping up with other countries. I would like everybody to end it, just get rid of it. But I would certainly not do first strike. I think that once the nuclear alternative happens, it\'s over. At the same time, we have to be prepared. I can\'t take anything off the table. Because you look at some of these countries, you look at North Korea, we\'re doing nothing there. China should solve that problem for us. China should go into North Korea. China is totally powerful as it relates to North Korea. And by the way, another one powerful is the worst deal I think I\'ve ever seen negotiated that you started is the Iran deal. Iran is one of their biggest trading partners. Iran has power over North Korea. And when they made that horrible deal with Iran, they should have included the fact that they do something with respect to North Korea. And they should have done something with respect to Yemen and all these other places. And when asked to Secretary Kerry, why didn\'t you do that? Why didn\'t you add other things into the deal? One of the great giveaways of all time, of all time, including $400 million in cash. Nobody\'s ever seen that before. That turned out to be wrong. It was actually $1.7 billion in cash, obviously, I guess for the hostages. It certainly looks that way. So you say to yourself, why didn\'t they make the right deal? This is one of the worst deals ever made by any country in history. The deal with Iran will lead to nuclear problems. All they have to do is sit back 10 years, and they don\'t have to do much.', '9/26/16'),
('69', 'Holt', 'Your two minutes is expired.', '9/26/16'),
('69', 'Trump', 'And they\'re going to end up getting nuclear. I met with Bibi Netanyahu the other day. Believe me, he\'s not a happy camper.', '9/26/16'),
('69', 'Holt', 'All right. Mrs. Clinton, Secretary Clinton, you have two minutes.', '9/26/16'),
('69', 'Clinton', 'Well, let me -- let me start by saying, words matter. Words matter when you run for president. And they really matter when you are president. And I want to reassure our allies in Japan and South Korea and elsewhere that we have mutual defense treaties and we will honor them. It is essential that America\'s word be good. And so I know that this campaign has caused some questioning and worries on the part of many leaders across the globe. I\'ve talked with a number of them. But I want to -- on behalf of myself, and I think on behalf of a majority of the American people, say that, you know, our word is good. It\'s also important that we look at the entire global situation. There\'s no doubt that we have other problems with Iran. But personally, I\'d rather deal with the other problems having put that lid on their nuclear program than still to be facing that. And Donald never tells you what he would do. Would he have started a war? Would he have bombed Iran? If he\'s going to criticize a deal that has been very successful in giving us access to Iranian facilities that we never had before, then he should tell us what his alternative would be. But it\'s like his plan to defeat ISIS. He says it\'s a secret plan, but the only secret is that he has no plan. So we need to be more precise in how we talk about these issues. People around the word follow our presidential campaigns so closely, trying to get hints about what we will do. Can they rely on us? Are we going to lead the world with strength and in accordance with our values? That\'s what I intend to do. I intend to be a leader of our country that people can count on, both here at home and around the world, to make decisions that will further peace and prosperity, but also stand up to bullies, whether they\'re abroad or at home.

And if she ever wins this race, they won\'t be taken care of.', '9/26/16'),

Both are longtime public servants who are also proud fathers of sons serving in the U.S. Marines. The campaigns have agreed to the rules of this 90-minute debate. There will be nine different segments covering domestic and foreign policy issues. Each segment will begin with a question to both candidates who will each have two minutes to answer.

('69', 'Quijano', 'Gentlemen, welcome. It truly is a privilege to be with both of you tonight. I\'d like to start with the topic of presidential leadership. Twenty-eight years ago tomorrow night, Lloyd Bentsen said the vice presidential debate was not about the qualifications for the vice presidency, but about how if tragedy should occur, the vice president has to step in without any margin for error, without time for preparation, to take over the responsibility for the biggest job in the world. What about your qualities, your skills, and your temperament equip you to step into that role at a moment\'s notice? Senator Kaine?', '10/4/16'),
('69', 'Kaine', 'Elaine, thank you for being here tonight, and, Governor Pence, welcome. It is so great to be back at Longwood University in Farmville, Virginia. This is a very special place. Sixty-five years ago, a young, courageous woman, Barbara Johns, led a walkout of her high school, Moton High School. She made history by protesting school segregation. She believed our nation was stronger together. And that walkout led to the Brown v. Board of Education decision that moved us down the path toward equality. I am so proud to be running with another strong, history-making woman, Hillary Clinton, to be president of the United States. I\'m proud because her vision of stronger together, building an economy that works for all, not just those at the top, being safe in the world not only with a strong military, but also strong alliances to battle terrorism and climate change, and also to build a community of respect, just like Barbara Johns tried to do 65 years ago. That\'s why I\'m so proud to be her running mate. Hillary told me why she asked me to be her running mate. She said the test of a Clinton administration will not be the signing of a bill or the passage of a bill. It\'ll be whether we can make somebody\'s life better, whether we can make a classroom better learning environment for schoolkids or teachers, whether we can make a safer -- it\'s going to be about results. And she said to me, you\'ve been a missionary and a civil rights lawyer. You\'ve been a city councilman and mayor. You\'ve been a lieutenant governor and governor and now a U.S. senator. I think you will help me figure out how to govern this nation so that we always keep in mind that the success of the administration is the difference we make in people\'s lives. And that\'s what I bring to the ticket, that experience having served at all levels of government. But my primary role is to be Hillary Clinton\'s right-hand person and strong supporter as she puts together the most historic administration possible. And I relish that role. I\'m so proud of her.', '10/4/16'),

It\'s deeply humbling for me to be here, to be surrounded by my -- my wonderful family. And, Senator Kaine, it\'s an honor to be here with you, as well. And I just -- I also want to say -- I want to say thanks to everyone that\'s looking in tonight, who understands what an enormously important time this is in the life of our nation. For the last seven-and-a-half years, we\'ve seen America\'s place in the world weakened. We\'ve seen an economy stifled by more taxes, more regulation, a war on coal, and a failing health care reform come to be known as Obamacare, and the American people know that we need to make a change. And so I want to thank all of you for being -- being with us tonight.', '10/4/16'),
('69', 'Pence', 'I also want to thank Donald Trump for making that call and inviting us to be a part of this ticket. I have to tell you, I\'m a -- I\'m a small-town boy from a place not too different from Farmville. I grew up with a cornfield in my backyard. My grandfather had immigrated to this country when he was about my son\'s age. My mom and dad built a -- everything that matters in a small town in Southern Indiana. They built a family and -- and a good name and a business. And they raised a family. And I dreamed some day of representing my home town in Washington, D.C., but I -- honestly, Elaine, I never imagined -- never imagined I\'d have the opportunity to be governor of the state that I love, let alone be sitting at a table like this in this kind of a position. So to answer your question, I would say I -- I would hope that if -- if the responsibility ever fell to me in this role, that I would meet it with the way that I\'m going to meet the responsibility should I be elected vice president of the United States. And that\'s to bring a lifetime of experience, a lifetime growing up in a small town, a lifetime where I\'ve served in the Congress of the United States, where -- where I\'ve led a state that works in the great state of Indiana, and whatever other responsibilities might follow from this, I -- I would hope and, frankly, I would pray to be able to meet that moment with that -- that lifetime of experience.', '10/4/16'),

Do they have a passion in their life that showed up before they were in public life? And have they held onto that passion throughout their life, regardless of whether they were in office or not, succeeding or failing? Hillary Clinton has that passion. From a time as a kid in a Methodist youth group in the suburbs of Chicago, she has been focused on serving others with a special focus on empowering families and kids. As a civil rights lawyer in the South, with the Children\'s Defense Fund, first lady of Arkansas and this country, senator, secretary of state, it\'s always been about putting others first. And that\'s a sharp contrast with Donald Trump. Donald Trump always puts himself first. He built a business career, in the words of one of his own campaign staffers, \"off the backs of the little guy.\" And as a candidate, he started his campaign with a speech where he called Mexicans rapists and criminals, and he has pursued the discredited and really outrageous lie that President Obama wasn\'t born in the United States. It is so painful to suggest that we go back to think about these days where an African-American could not be a citizen of the United States.

I mean, the situation we\'re watching hour by hour in Syria today is the result of the failed foreign policy and the weak foreign policy that Hillary Clinton helped lead in this administration and create.

That\'s a little bit different than when Senator Kaine was governor here in Virginia. He actually -- he actually tried to raise taxes by about $4 billion.

It really is remarkable that they actually are advocating a trillion dollars in tax increases, which I get that. You tried to raise taxes here in Virginia and were unsuccessful. But a trillion dollars in tax increases, more regulation, more of the same war on coal, and more of Obamacare that now even former President Bill Clinton calls Obamacare a crazy plan. But Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine want to build on Obamacare. They want to expand it into a single-payer program. And for all the world, Hillary Clinton just thinks Obamacare is a good start. Look, Donald Trump and I have a plan to get this economy moving again just the way that it worked in the 1980s, just the way it worked in the 1960s, and that is by lowering taxes across the board for working families, small businesses and family farms, ending the war on coal that is hurting jobs and hurting this economy even here in Virginia, repealing Obamacare lock, stock, and barrel, and repealing all of the executive orders that Barack Obama has signed that are stifling economic growth in this economy. We can get America moving again. Put on top of that the kind of trade deals that\'ll put the American worker first, and you\'ve got a prescription for real growth. And when you get the economy growing, Elaine, that\'s when you can deal with the national debt. When we get back to 3.5 percent to 4 percent growth with Donald Trump\'s plan will do, then we\'re going to have the resources to meet our nation\'s needs at home and abroad, and we\'re going to have the ability to bring down the national debt.', '10/4/16'),

('69', 'Kaine', 'Elaine, on the economy, there\'s a fundamental choice for the American electorate. Do you want a \"you\'re hired\" president in Hillary Clinton or do you want a \"you\'re fired\" president in Donald Trump? I think that\'s not such a hard choice. Hillary and I have a plan that\'s on the table that\'s a \"you\'re hired\" plan. Five components. First thing we do is we invest in manufacturing, infrastructure, and research in the clean energy jobs of tomorrow. Second thing is we invest in our workforce, from pre-K education to great teachers to debt-free college and tuition-free college for families that make less than $125,000 a year. Third, we promote fairness by raising the minimum wage, so you can\'t work full-time and be under the poverty level, and by paying women equal pay for equal work. Fourth, we promote small business growth, just as we\'ve done in Virginia, to make it easier to start and grow small businesses. Hillary and I each grew up in small-business families. My dad, who ran an iron working and welding shop, is here tonight. And, fifth, we have a tax plan that targets tax relief to middle- class individuals and small businesses and asks those at the very top who\'ve benefited as we\'ve come out of recession to pay more.', '10/4/16'),
('69', 'Kaine', 'The Trump plan is a different plan. It\'s a \"you\'re fired\" plan. And there\'s two key elements to it. First, Donald Trump said wages are too high. And both Donald Trump and Mike Pence think we ought to eliminate the federal minimum wage. Mike Pence, when he was in Congress, voted against raising the minimum wage above $5.15. And he has been a one-man bulwark against minimum wage increases in Indiana. The second component of the plan is massive tax breaks for the very top, trillions of dollars of tax breaks for people just like Donald Trump. The problem with this, Elaine, is that\'s exactly what we did 10 years ago and it put the economy into the deepest recession -- the deepest recession since the 1930s. Independent analysts say the Clinton plan would grow the economy by 10.5 million jobs. The Trump plan would cost 3.5 million jobs. And Donald Trump -- why would he do this? Because his tax plan basically helps him. And if he ever met his promise and he gave his tax returns to the American public like he said he would, we would see just how much his economic plan is really a Trump-first plan.', '10/4/16'),

I was a city councilman and mayor in Richmond. And when I came in, we had one of the highest homicide rates in the United States. We fought very, very hard over the course of my time in local office with our police department, and we reduced our homicide rate nearly in half. And then when I was governor of Virginia, we worked hard, too. And we did something we had really wanted to do. For the first time ever, we cracked the top 10, 10 safest states, because we worked together. Here\'s what I learned as a mayor and a governor. The way you make communities safer and the way you make police safer is through community policing. You build the bonds between the community and the police force, build bonds of understanding, and then when people feel comfortable in their communities, that gap between the police and the communities they serve narrows. And when that gap narrows, it\'s safer for the communities and it\'s safer for the police. That model still works across our country, but there are some other models that don\'t work, an overly aggressive, more militarized model. Donald Trump recently said we need to do more stop-and-frisk around the country. That would be a big mistake because it polarizes the relationship between the police and the community. So here\'s what we\'ll do. We\'ll focus on community policing. We will focus on -- and Hillary Clinton has rolled out a really comprehensive mental health reform package that she worked on with law enforcement professionals, and we will also fight the scourge of gun violence in the United States. I\'m a gun-owner. I\'m a strong Second Amendment supporter. But I\'ve got a lot of scar tissue, because when I was governor of Virginia, there was a horrible shooting at Virginia Tech, and we learned that through that painful situation that gaps in the background record check system should have been closed and it could have prevented that crime, and so we\'re going to work to do things like close background record checks. And if we do, we won\'t have the tragedies that we did. One of those killed at Virginia Tech was a guy named Liviu Librescu. He was a 70-plus-year-old Romanian Holocaust survivor. He had survived the Holocaust. Then he survived the Soviet Union takeover of his country. But then he was a visiting professor at Virginia Tech, and he couldn\'t survive the scourge of gun violence.

And the men and women, white, African-American, Asian, Latino, Hispanic, they put their lives on the line every single day. And let my say, at the risk of agreeing with you, community policing is a great idea. It\'s worked in the Hoosier state. And we fully support that. Donald Trump and I are going to make sure that law enforcement have the resources and the tools to be able to really restore law and order to the cities and communities in this nation. It\'s probably -- probably why the 330,000 members of the Fraternal Order of Police endorsed Donald Trump as the next president of the United States of America, because they see his commitment to them. They see his commitment to law and order. But they also -- they also hear the bad mouthing, the bad mouthing that comes from people that seize upon tragedy in the wake of police action shootings as -- as a reason to -- to use a broad brush to accuse law enforcement of -- of implicit bias or institutional racism.

I mean, I -- we -- we mourn with those who mourn. We -- we grieve with those who grieve. And we\'re saddened at the loss of life.

Remember, Hillary Clinton was the senator from New York on 9/11. She was there at the World Trade Center when they were still searching for victims and survivors. That\'s seared onto her, the need to beat terrorism. And she\'s got a plan to do it. She was part of the national security team that wiped out bin Laden. Here\'s her plan to defeat ISIL. First, we\'ve got to keep taking out their leaders on the battlefield. She was part of the team that got bin Laden, and she\'ll lead the team that will get Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the head of ISIS. Second, we\'ve got to disrupt financing networks, third, disrupt their ability to recruit on the Internet, in their safe havens.

He said, \"I have a secret plan,\" and then he said, \"Um, I know more than all the generals about ISIL.\" And then he said, \"I\'m going to call the generals to help me figure out a plan.\" And finally he said, \"I\'m going to fire all the generals.\" He doesn\'t have a plan. But he does have dangerous ideas. Here\'s four. He trash talks the military. The military is a disaster, John McCain\'s no hero, the generals need all to be fired, and I know more than them.

('69', 'Kaine', 'Intelligence surge is two-thirds, Elaine. It\'s two things. It\'s, first, dramatically expanding our intelligence capacities by hiring great professionals, but also we\'ve got some of the best intel and cyber employees in the world right here in the United States working for many of our private sector companies. So it involves increasing our own workforce, but striking great partnerships with some of our cyber and intel experts in the private sector so that we can, consistent with constitutional principles, gather more intelligence. But the second piece of this is really, really important. It also means creating stronger alliances, because you gather intelligence and then you share your intelligence back and forth with allies. And that\'s how you find out who may be trying to recruit, who may be trying to come to one country or the next. Alliances are critical. That\'s why Donald Trump\'s claim that he wants to -- that NATO is obsolete and that we need to get rid of NATO is so dangerous.', '10/4/16'),

And that\'s what an intelligence surge means. Better skill and capacity, but also better alliances.', '10/4/16'),

Hillary Clinton\'s top priority when she became secretary of state was the Russian reset, the Russians reset. After the Russian reset, the Russians invaded Ukraine and took over Crimea. And the small and bullying leader of Russia is now dictating terms to the United States to the point where all the United States of America -- the greatest nation on Earth -- just withdraws from talks about a cease-fire while Vladimir Putin puts a missile defense system in Syria while he marshals the forces and begins -- look, we have got to begin to lean into this with strong, broad-shouldered American leadership. It begins by rebuilding our military. And the Russians and the Chinese have been making enormous investments in the military. We have the smallest Navy since 1916. We have the lowest number of troops since the end of the Second World War. We\'ve got to work with Congress, and Donald Trump will, to rebuild our military and project American strength in the world. But about Aleppo and about Syria, I truly do believe that what America ought to do right now is immediately establish safe zones, so that families and vulnerable families with children can move out of those areas, work with our Arab partners, real time, right now, to make that happen. And secondly, I just have to tell you that the provocations by Russia need to be met with American strength. And if Russia chooses to be involved and continue, I should say, to be involved in this barbaric attack on civilians in Aleppo, the United States of America should be prepared to use military force to strike military targets of the Assad regime to prevent them from this humanitarian crisis that is taking place in Aleppo. There\'s a broad range of other things that we ought to do, as well.

Donald Trump, again and again, has praised Vladimir Putin. And it\'s clear that he has business dealings with Russian oligarchs who are very connected to Putin. The Trump campaign management team had to be fired a month or so ago because of those shadowy connections with pro-Putin forces. Governor Pence made the odd claim, he said inarguably Vladimir Putin is a better leader than President Obama. Vladimir Putin has run his economy into the ground.

So get this. On 9/11, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump\'s hometown was attacked by the worst terrorist attack in the history of the United States. Young men and women -- young men and women signed up to serve in the military to fight terrorism.

('69', 'QUESTION', 'Thank you, and good evening. The last debate could have been rated as MA, mature audiences, per TV parental guidelines.

('69', 'Clinton', 'Well, thank you. Are you a teacher? Yes, I think that that\'s a very good question, because I\'ve heard from lots of teachers and parents about some of their concerns about some of the things that are being said and done in this campaign. And I think it is very important for us to make clear to our children that our country really is great because we\'re good. And we are going to respect one another, lift each other up. We are going to be looking for ways to celebrate our diversity, and we are going to try to reach out to every boy and girl, as well as every adult, to bring them in to working on behalf of our country. I have a very positive and optimistic view about what we can do together. That\'s why the slogan of my campaign is \"Stronger Together,\" because I think if we work together, if we overcome the divisiveness that sometimes sets Americans against one another, and instead we make some big goals -- and I\'ve set forth some big goals, getting the economy to work for everyone, not just those at the top, making sure that we have the best education system from preschool through college and making it affordable, and so much else. If we set those goals and we go together to try to achieve them, there\'s nothing in my opinion that America can\'t do. So that\'s why I hope that we will come together in this campaign. Obviously, I\'m hoping to earn your vote, I\'m hoping to be elected in November, and I can promise you, I will work with every American. I want to be the president for all Americans, regardless of your political beliefs, where you come from, what you look like, your religion. I want us to heal our country and bring it together because that\'s, I think, the best way for us to get the future that our children and our grandchildren deserve. ', '10/9/16'),
('69', 'Cooper', 'Secretary Clinton, thank you. Mr. Trump, you have two minutes. ', '10/9/16'),
('69', 'Trump', 'Well, I actually agree with that. I agree with everything she said. I began this campaign because I was so tired of seeing such foolish things happen to our country. This is a great country. This is a great land. I\'ve gotten to know the people of the country over the last year-and-a-half that I\'ve been doing this as a politician. I cannot believe I\'m saying that about myself, but I guess I have been a politician. ', '10/9/16'),
('69', 'Trump', 'And my whole concept was to make America great again. When I watch the deals being made, when I watch what\'s happening with some horrible things like Obamacare, where your health insurance and health care is going up by numbers that are astronomical, 68 percent, 59 percent, 71 percent, when I look at the Iran deal and how bad a deal it is for us, it\'s a one-sided transaction where we\'re giving back $150 billion to a terrorist state, really, the number one terror state, we\'ve made them a strong country from really a very weak country just three years ago. When I look at all of the things that I see and all of the potential that our country has, we have such tremendous potential, whether it\'s in business and trade, where we\'re doing so badly. Last year, we had almost $800 billion trade deficit. In other words, trading with other countries. We had an $800 billion deficit. It\'s hard to believe. Inconceivable. You say who\'s making these deals? We\'re going the make great deals. We\'re going to have a strong border. We\'re going to bring back law and order. Just today, policemen was shot, two killed. And this is happening on a weekly basis. We have to bring back respect to law enforcement. At the same time, we have to take care of people on all sides. We need justice. But I want to do things that haven\'t been done, including fixing and making our inner cities better for the African-American citizens that are so great, and for the Latinos, Hispanics, and I look forward to doing it. It\'s called make America great again. ', '10/9/16'),
('69', 'Cooper', 'Thank you, Mr. Trump. The question from Patrice was about are you both modeling positive and appropriate behavior for today\'s youth? We received a lot of questions online, Mr. Trump, about the tape that was released on Friday, as you can imagine. You called what you said locker room banter. You described kissing women without consent, grabbing their genitals. That is sexual assault. You bragged that you have sexually assaulted women. Do you understand that? ', '10/9/16'),
('69', 'Trump', 'No, I didn\'t say that at all. I don\'t think you understood what was -- this was locker room talk. I\'m not proud of it. I apologize to my family. I apologize to the American people. Certainly I\'m not proud of it. But this is locker room talk. You know, when we have a world where you have ISIS chopping off heads, where you have -- and, frankly, drowning people in steel cages, where you have wars and horrible, horrible sights all over, where you have so many bad things happening, this is like medieval times. We haven\'t seen anything like this, the carnage all over the world. And they look and they see. Can you imagine the people that are, frankly, doing so well against us with ISIS? And they look at our country and they see what\'s going on. Yes, I\'m very embarrassed by it. I hate it. But it\'s locker room talk, and it\'s one of those things. I will knock the hell out of ISIS. We\'re going to defeat ISIS. ISIS happened a number of years ago in a vacuum that was left because of bad judgment. And I will tell you, I will take care of ISIS. ', '10/9/16'),

We\'re going to have borders in our country, which we don\'t have now. People are pouring into our country, and they\'re coming in from the Middle East and other places. We\'re going to make America safe again. We\'re going to make America great again, but we\'re going to make America safe again.

('69', 'Cooper', 'Secretary Clinton, do you want to respond? ', '10/9/16'),
('69', 'Clinton', 'Well, like everyone else, I\'ve spent a lot of time thinking over the last 48 hours about what we heard and saw. You know, with prior Republican nominees for president, I disagreed with them on politics, policies, principles, but I never questioned their fitness to serve. Donald Trump is different. I said starting back in June that he was not fit to be president and commander-in-chief. And many Republicans and independents have said the same thing. What we all saw and heard on Friday was Donald talking about women, what he thinks about women, what he does to women. And he has said that the video doesn\'t represent who he is. But I think it\'s clear to anyone who heard it that it represents exactly who he is. Because we\'ve seen this throughout the campaign. We have seen him insult women. We\'ve seen him rate women on their appearance, ranking them from one to ten. We\'ve seen him embarrass women on TV and on Twitter. We saw him after the first debate spend nearly a week denigrating a former Miss Universe in the harshest, most personal terms. So, yes, this is who Donald Trump is. But it\'s not only women, and it\'s not only this video that raises questions about his fitness to be our president, because he has also targeted immigrants, African- Americans, Latinos, people with disabilities, POWs, Muslims, and so many others. So this is who Donald Trump is. And the question for us, the question our country must answer is that this is not who we are. That\'s why -- to go back to your question -- I want to send a message -- we all should -- to every boy and girl and, indeed, to the entire world that America already is great, but we are great because we are good, and we will respect one another, and we will work with one another, and we will celebrate our diversity. ', '10/9/16'),

I heard them when they were running for the Senate in New York, where Hillary was going to bring back jobs to upstate New York and she failed. I\'ve heard them where Hillary is constantly talking about the inner cities of our country, which are a disaster education-wise, jobwise, safety-wise, in every way possible. I\'m going to help the African-Americans. I\'m going to help the Latinos, Hispanics. I am going to help the inner cities. She\'s done a terrible job for the African-Americans. She wants their vote, and she does nothing, and then she comes back four years later. We saw that firsthand when she was United States senator. She campaigned where the primary part of her campaign... ', '10/9/16'),

('69', 'Raddatz', 'This tape is generating intense interest. In just 48 hours, it\'s become the single most talked about story of the entire 2016 election on Facebook, with millions and millions of people discussing it on the social network. As we said a moment ago, we do want to bring in questions from voters around country via social media, and our first stays on this topic. Jeff from Ohio asks on Facebook, \"Trump says the campaign has changed him. When did that happen?\" So, Mr. Trump, let me add to that. When you walked off that bus at age 59, were you a different man or did that behavior continue until just recently? And you have two minutes for this. ', '10/9/16'),

I am a person who has great respect for people, for my family, for the people of this country. And certainly, I\'m not proud of it. But that was something that happened. If you look at Bill Clinton, far worse. Mine are words, and his was action. His was what he\'s done to women. There\'s never been anybody in the history politics in this nation that\'s been so abusive to women. So you can say any way you want to say it, but Bill Clinton was abusive to women. Hillary Clinton attacked those same women and attacked them viciously. Four of them here tonight. One of the women, who is a wonderful woman, at 12 years old, was raped at 12. Her client she represented got him off, and she\'s seen laughing on two separate occasions, laughing at the girl who was raped. Kathy Shelton, that young woman is here with us tonight. So don\'t tell me about words. I am absolutely -- I apologize for those words. But it is things that people say. But what President Clinton did, he was impeached, he lost his license to practice law. He had to pay an $850,000 fine to one of the women. Paula Jones, who\'s also here tonight. And I will tell you that when Hillary brings up a point like that and she talks about words that I said 11 years ago, I think it\'s disgraceful, and I think she should be ashamed of herself, if you want to know the truth.', '10/9/16'),

He gets to decide what he wants to talk about. Instead of answering people\'s questions, talking about our agenda, laying out the plans that we have that we think can make a better life and a better country, that\'s his choice.

('69', 'Clinton', 'He never apologized to Mr. and Mrs. Khan, the Gold Star family whose son, Captain Khan, died in the line of duty in Iraq. And Donald insulted and attacked them for weeks over their religion. He never apologized to the distinguished federal judge who was born in Indiana, but Donald said he couldn\'t be trusted to be a judge because his parents were, quote, \"Mexican.\" He never apologized to the reporter that he mimicked and mocked on national television and our children were watching. And he never apologized for the racist lie that President Obama was not born in the United States of America. He owes the president an apology, he owes our country an apology, and he needs to take responsibility for his actions and his words. ', '10/9/16'),
('69', 'Trump', 'Well, you owe the president an apology, because as you know very well, your campaign, Sidney Blumenthal -- he\'s another real winner that you have -- and he\'s the one that got this started, along with your campaign manager, and they were on television just two weeks ago, she was, saying exactly that. So you really owe him an apology. You\'re the one that sent the pictures around your campaign, sent the pictures around with President Obama in a certain garb. That was long before I was ever involved, so you actually owe an apology. Number two, Michelle Obama. I\'ve gotten to see the commercials that they did on you. And I\'ve gotten to see some of the most vicious commercials I\'ve ever seen of Michelle Obama talking about you, Hillary. So, you talk about friend? Go back and take a look at those commercials, a race where you lost fair and square, unlike the Bernie Sanders race, where you won, but not fair and square, in my opinion. And all you have to do is take a look at WikiLeaks and just see what they say about Bernie Sanders and see what Deborah Wasserman Schultz had in mind, because Bernie Sanders, between super-delegates and Deborah Wasserman Schultz, he never had a chance. And I was so surprised to see him sign on with the devil. But when you talk about apology, I think the one that you should really be apologizing for and the thing that you should be apologizing for are the 33,000 e-mails that you deleted, and that you acid washed, and then the two boxes of e-mails and other things last week that were taken from an office and are now missing. And I\'ll tell you what. I didn\'t think I\'d say this, but I\'m going to say it, and I hate to say it. But if I win, I am going to instruct my attorney general to get a special prosecutor to look into your situation, because there has never been so many lies, so much deception. There has never been anything like it, and we\'re going to have a special prosecutor. When I speak, I go out and speak, the people of this country are furious. In my opinion, the people that have been long-term workers at the FBI are furious. There has never been anything like this, where e-mails -- and you get a subpoena, you get a subpoena, and after getting the subpoena, you delete 33,000 e-mails, and then you acid wash them or bleach them, as you would say, very expensive process. So we\'re going to get a special prosecutor, and we\'re going to look into it, because you know what? People have been -- their lives have been destroyed for doing one-fifth of what you\'ve done.

You disagreed with FBI Director James Comey, calling your handling of classified information, quote, \"extremely careless.\" The FBI said that there were 110 classified e-mails that were exchanged, eight of which were top secret, and that it was possible hostile actors did gain access to those e-mails.

But I think it\'s also important to point out where there are some misleading accusations from critics and others. After a year-long investigation, there is no evidence that anyone hacked the server I was using and there is no evidence that anyone can point to at all -- anyone who says otherwise has no basis -- that any classified material ended up in the wrong hands. I take classified materials very seriously and always have. When I was on the Senate Armed Services Committee, I was privy to a lot of classified material.

Well, maybe we\'ll give three or three or four or five or something. 33,000 e-mails deleted, and now she\'s saying there wasn\'t anything wrong. And more importantly, that was after getting a subpoena. That wasn\'t before. That was after. She got it from the United States Congress. And I\'ll be honest, I am so disappointed in congressmen, including Republicans, for allowing this to happen. Our Justice Department, where our husband goes on to the back of a airplane for 39 minutes, talks to the attorney general days before a ruling is going to be made on her case.

('69', 'QUESTION', 'Thank you. Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, it is not affordable. Premiums have gone up. Deductibles have gone up. Copays have gone up. Prescriptions have gone up. And the coverage has gone down. What will you do to bring the cost down and make coverage better? ', '10/9/16'),
('69', 'Cooper', 'That first one goes to Secretary Clinton, because you started out the last one to the audience. ', '10/9/16'),
('69', 'Clinton', 'If he wants to start, he can start. No, go ahead, Donald. ', '10/9/16'),
('69', 'Trump', 'No, I\'m a gentlemen, Hillary. Go ahead.', '10/9/16'),
('69', 'Audience', '(LAUGHTER)', '10/9/16'),
('69', 'Cooper', 'Secretary Clinton?', '10/9/16'),
('69', 'Clinton', 'Well, I think Donald was about to say he\'s going to solve it by repealing it and getting rid of the Affordable Care Act. And I\'m going to fix it, because I agree with you. Premiums have gotten too high. Copays, deductibles, prescription drug costs, and I\'ve laid out a series of actions that we can take to try to get those costs down. But here\'s what I don\'t want people to forget when we\'re talking about reining in the costs, which has to be the highest priority of the next president, when the Affordable Care Act passed, it wasn\'t just that 20 million got insurance who didn\'t have it before. But that in and of itself was a good thing. I meet these people all the time, and they tell me what a difference having that insurance meant to them and their families. But everybody else, the 170 million of us who get health insurance through our employees got big benefits. Number one, insurance companies can\'t deny you coverage because of a pre-existing condition. Number two, no lifetime limits, which is a big deal if you have serious health problems. Number three, women can\'t be charged more than men for our health insurance, which is the way it used to be before the Affordable Care Act. Number four, if you\'re under 26, and your parents have a policy, you can be on that policy until the age of 26, something that didn\'t happen before. So I want very much to save what works and is good about the Affordable Care Act. But we\'ve got to get costs down. We\'ve got to provide additional help to small businesses so that they can afford to provide health insurance. But if we repeal it, as Donald has proposed, and start over again, all of those benefits I just mentioned are lost to everybody, not just people who get their health insurance on the exchange. And then we would have to start all over again. Right now, we are at 90 percent health insurance coverage. That\'s the highest we\'ve ever been in our country. ', '10/9/16'),
('69', 'Cooper', 'Secretary Clinton, your time is up. ', '10/9/16'),
('69', 'Clinton', 'So I want us to get to 100 percent, but get costs down and keep quality up. ', '10/9/16'),
('69', 'Cooper', 'Mr. Trump, you have two minutes. ', '10/9/16'),
('69', 'Trump', 'It is such a great question and it\'s maybe the question I get almost more than anything else, outside of defense. Obamacare is a disaster. You know it. We all know it. It\'s going up at numbers that nobody\'s ever seen worldwide. Nobody\'s ever seen numbers like this for health care. It\'s only getting worse. In \'17, it implodes by itself. Their method of fixing it is to go back and ask Congress for more money, more and more money. We have right now almost $20 trillion in debt. Obamacare will never work. It\'s very bad, very bad health insurance. Far too expensive. And not only expensive for the person that has it, unbelievably expensive for our country. It\'s going to be one of the biggest line items very shortly. We have to repeal it and replace it with something absolutely much less expensive and something that works, where your plan can actually be tailored. We have to get rid of the lines around the state, artificial lines, where we stop insurance companies from coming in and competing, because they want -- and President Obama and whoever was working on it -- they want to leave those lines, because that gives the insurance companies essentially monopolies. We want competition. You will have the finest health care plan there is. She wants to go to a single-payer plan, which would be a disaster, somewhat similar to Canada. And if you haven\'t noticed the Canadians, when they need a big operation, when something happens, they come into the United States in many cases because their system is so slow. It\'s catastrophic in certain ways. But she wants to go to single payer, which means the government basically rules everything. Hillary Clinton has been after this for years. Obamacare was the first step. Obamacare is a total disaster. And not only are your rates going up by numbers that nobody\'s ever believed, but your deductibles are going up, so that unless you get hit by a truck, you\'re never going to be able to use it. ', '10/9/16'),
('69', 'Cooper', 'Mr. Trump, your time... ', '10/9/16'),
('69', 'Trump', 'It is a disastrous plan, and it has to be repealed and replaced. ', '10/9/16'),
('69', 'Cooper', 'Secretary Clinton, let me follow up with you. Your husband called Obamacare, quote, \"the craziest thing in the world,\" saying that small-business owners are getting killed as premiums double, coverage is cut in half. Was he mistaken or was the mistake simply telling the truth? ', '10/9/16'),
('69', 'Clinton', 'No, I mean, he clarified what he meant. And it\'s very clear. Look, we are in a situation in our country where if we were to start all over again, we might come up with a different system. But we have an employer-based system. That\'s where the vast majority of people get their health care. And the Affordable Care Act was meant to try to fill the gap between people who were too poor and couldn\'t put together any resources to afford health care, namely people on Medicaid. Obviously, Medicare, which is a single-payer system, which takes care of our elderly and does a great job doing it, by the way, and then all of the people who were employed, but people who were working but didn\'t have the money to afford insurance and didn\'t have anybody, an employer or anybody else, to help them. That was the slot that the Obamacare approach was to take. And like I say, 20 million people now have health insurance. So if we just rip it up and throw it away, what Donald\'s not telling you is we just turn it back to the insurance companies the way it used to be, and that means the insurance companies...

('69', 'Cooper', 'Your time is up.', '10/9/16'),
('69', 'Clinton', '... you may not be able to have insurance because you can\'t afford it. So let\'s fix what\'s broken about it, but let\'s not throw it away and give it all back to the insurance companies and the drug companies. That\'s not going to work. ', '10/9/16'),
('69', 'Cooper', 'Mr. Trump, let me follow up on this. ', '10/9/16'),

('69', 'Trump', 'By the way...', '10/9/16'),
('69', 'Cooper', 'You\'ve said you want to end Obamacare. You\'ve also said you want to make coverage accessible for people with pre-existing conditions. How do you force insurance companies to do that if you\'re no longer mandating that every American get insurance?', '10/9/16'),
('69', 'Trump', 'We\'re going to be able to. You\'re going to have plans...', '10/9/16'),
('69', 'Cooper', 'What does that mean?', '10/9/16'),
('69', 'Trump', 'Well, I\'ll tell you what it means. You\'re going to have plans that are so good, because we\'re going to have so much competition in the insurance industry. Once we break out -- once we break out the lines and allow the competition to come... ', '10/9/16'),
('69', 'Cooper', 'Are you going -- are you going to have a mandate that Americans have to have health insurance?', '10/9/16'),
('69', 'Trump', 'President Obama -- Anderson, excuse me. President Obama, by keeping those lines, the boundary lines around each state, it was almost gone until just very toward the end of the passage of Obamacare, which, by the way, was a fraud. You know that, because Jonathan Gruber, the architect of Obamacare, was said -- he said it was a great lie, it was a big lie. President Obama said you keep your doctor, you keep your plan. The whole thing was a fraud, and it doesn\'t work. But when we get rid of those lines, you will have competition, and we will be able to keep pre-existing, we\'ll also be able to help people that can\'t get -- don\'t have money because we are going to have people protected. And Republicans feel this way, believe it or not, and strongly this way. We\'re going to block grant into the states. We\'re going to block grant into Medicaid into the states... ', '10/9/16'),

('69', 'Raddatz', 'We now go to Gorbah Hamed with a question for both candidates.', '10/9/16'),
('69', 'QUESTION', 'Hi. There are 3.3 million Muslims in the United States, and I\'m one of them. You\'ve mentioned working with Muslim nations, but with Islamophobia on the rise, how will you help people like me deal with the consequences of being labeled as a threat to the country after the election is over? ', '10/9/16'),
('69', 'Raddatz', 'Mr. Trump, you\'re first. ', '10/9/16'),
('69', 'Trump', 'Well, you\'re right about Islamophobia, and that\'s a shame. But one thing we have to do is we have to make sure that -- because there is a problem. I mean, whether we like it or not, and we could be very politically correct, but whether we like it or not, there is a problem. And we have to be sure that Muslims come in and report when they see something going on. When they see hatred going on, they have to report it. As an example, in San Bernardino, many people saw the bombs all over the apartment of the two people that killed 14 and wounded many, many people. Horribly wounded. They\'ll never be the same. Muslims have to report the problems when they see them. And, you know, there\'s always a reason for everything. If they don\'t do that, it\'s a very difficult situation for our country, because you look at Orlando and you look at San Bernardino and you look at the World Trade Center. Go outside. Look at Paris. Look at that horrible -- these are radical Islamic terrorists. And she won\'t even mention the word and nor will President Obama. He won\'t use the term \"radical Islamic terrorism.\" Now, to solve a problem, you have to be able to state what the problem is or at least say the name. She won\'t say the name and President Obama won\'t say the name. But the name is there. It\'s radical Islamic terror. And before you solve it, you have to say the name. ', '10/9/16'),
('69', 'Raddatz', 'Secretary Clinton?', '10/9/16'),
('69', 'Clinton', 'Well, thank you for asking your question. And I\'ve heard this question from a lot of Muslim-Americans across our country, because, unfortunately, there\'s been a lot of very divisive, dark things said about Muslims. And even someone like Captain Khan, the young man who sacrificed himself defending our country in the United States Army, has been subject to attack by Donald. I want to say just a couple of things. First, we\'ve had Muslims in America since George Washington. And we\'ve had many successful Muslims. We just lost a particular well-known one with Muhammad Ali. ', '10/9/16'),
('69', 'Clinton', 'My vision of America is an America where everyone has a place, if you\'re willing to work hard, you do your part, you contribute to the community. That\'s what America is. That\'s what we want America to be for our children and our grandchildren. It\'s also very short-sighted and even dangerous to be engaging in the kind of demagogic rhetoric that Donald has about Muslims. We need American Muslims to be part of our eyes and ears on our front lines. I\'ve worked with a lot of different Muslim groups around America. I\'ve met with a lot of them, and I\'ve heard how important it is for them to feel that they are wanted and included and part of our country, part of our homeland security, and that\'s what I want to see. It\'s also important I intend to defeat ISIS, to do so in a coalition with majority Muslim nations. Right now, a lot of those nations are hearing what Donald says and wondering, why should we cooperate with the Americans? And this is a gift to ISIS and the terrorists, violent jihadist terrorists. We are not at war with Islam. And it is a mistake and it plays into the hands of the terrorists to act as though we are. So I want a country where citizens like you and your family are just as welcome as anyone else. ', '10/9/16'),
('69', 'Raddatz', 'Thank you, Secretary Clinton. Mr. Trump, in December, you said this. \"Donald J. Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country\'s representatives can figure out what the hell is going on. We have no choice. We have no choice.\" Your running mate said this week that the Muslim ban is no longer your position. Is that correct? And if it is, was it a mistake to have a religious test? ', '10/9/16'),
('69', 'Trump', 'First of all, Captain Khan is an American hero, and if I were president at that time, he would be alive today, because unlike her, who voted for the war without knowing what she was doing, I would not have had our people in Iraq. Iraq was disaster. So he would have been alive today. The Muslim ban is something that in some form has morphed into a extreme vetting from certain areas of the world. Hillary Clinton wants to allow hundreds of thousands -- excuse me. Excuse me.. ', '10/9/16'),
('69', 'Raddatz', 'And why did it morph into that? No, did you -- no, answer the question. Do you still believe... ', '10/9/16'),

('69', 'Trump', 'Why don\'t you interrupt her?', '10/9/16'),
('69', 'Raddatz', 'Would you please explain whether or not the Muslim ban still stands?', '10/9/16'),
('69', 'Trump', 'It\'s called extreme vetting. We are going to areas like Syria where they\'re coming in by the tens of thousands because of Barack Obama. And Hillary Clinton wants to allow a 550 percent increase over Obama. People are coming into our country like we have no idea who they are, where they are from, what their feelings about our country is, and she wants 550 percent more. This is going to be the great Trojan horse of all time. We have enough problems in this country. I believe in building safe zones. I believe in having other people pay for them, as an example, the Gulf states, who are not carrying their weight, but they have nothing but money, and take care of people. But I don\'t want to have, with all the problems this country has and all of the problems that you see going on, hundreds of thousands of people coming in from Syria when we know nothing about them. We know nothing about their values and we know nothing about their love for our country. ', '10/9/16'),
('69', 'Raddatz', 'And, Secretary Clinton, let me ask you about that, because you have asked for an increase from 10,000 to 65,000 Syrian refugees. We know you want tougher vetting. That\'s not a perfect system. So why take the risk of having those refugees come into the country? ', '10/9/16'),
('69', 'Clinton', 'Well, first of all, I will not let anyone into our country that I think poses a risk to us. But there are a lot of refugees, women and children -- think of that picture we all saw of that 4-year-old boy with the blood on his forehead because he\'d been bombed by the Russian and Syrian air forces. There are children suffering in this catastrophic war, largely, I believe, because of Russian aggression. And we need to do our part. We by no means are carrying anywhere near the load that Europe and others are. But we will have vetting that is as tough as it needs to be from our professionals, our intelligence experts and others. But it is important for us as a policy, you know, not to say, as Donald has said, we\'re going to ban people based on a religion. How do you do that? We are a country founded on religious freedom and liberty. How do we do what he has advocated without causing great distress within our own county? Are we going to have religious tests when people fly into our country? And how do we expect to be able to implement those? So I thought that what he said was extremely unwise and even dangerous. And indeed, you can look at the propaganda on a lot of the terrorists sites, and what Donald Trump says about Muslims is used to recruit fighters, because they want to create a war between us. And the final thing I would say, this is the 10th or 12th time that he\'s denied being for the war in Iraq. We have it on tape. The entire press corps has looked at it. It\'s been debunked, but it never stops him from saying whatever he wants to say. ', '10/9/16'),

('69', 'Trump', 'Hillary Clinton, in terms of having people come into our country, we have many criminal illegal aliens. When we want to send them back to their country, their country says we don\'t want them. In some cases, they\'re murderers, drug lords, drug problems. And they don\'t want them. And Hillary Clinton, when she was secretary of state, said that\'s OK, we can\'t force it into their country. Let me tell you, I\'m going to force them right back into their country. They\'re murderers and some very bad people. And I will tell you very strongly, when Bernie Sanders said she had bad judgment, she has really bad judgment, because we are letting people into this country that are going to cause problems and crime like you\'ve never seen. We\'re also letting drugs pour through our southern border at a record clip. At a record clip. And it shouldn\'t be allowed to happen. ICE just endorsed me. They\'ve never endorsed a presidential candidate. The Border Patrol agents, 16,500, just recently endorsed me, and they endorsed me because I understand the border. She doesn\'t. She wants amnesty for everybody. Come right in. Come right over. It\'s a horrible thing she\'s doing.

As I recall, that was something I said about Abraham Lincoln after having seen the wonderful Steven Spielberg movie called \"Lincoln.\" It was a master class watching President Lincoln get the Congress to approve the 13th Amendment. It was principled, and it was strategic. And I was making the point that it is hard sometimes to get the Congress to do what you want to do and you have to keep working at it. And, yes, President Lincoln was trying to convince some people, he used some arguments, convincing other people, he used other arguments. That was a great -- I thought a great display of presidential leadership. But, you know, let\'s talk about what\'s really going on here, Martha, because our intelligence community just came out and said in the last few days that the Kremlin, meaning Putin and the Russian government, are directing the attacks, the hacking on American accounts to influence our election. And WikiLeaks is part of that, as are other sites where the Russians hack information, we don\'t even know if it\'s accurate information, and then they put it out. We have never in the history of our country been in a situation where an adversary, a foreign power, is working so hard to influence the outcome of the election. And believe me, they\'re not doing it to get me elected. They\'re doing it to try to influence the election for Donald Trump. ', '10/9/16'),
('69', 'Clinton', 'Now, maybe because he has praised Putin, maybe because he says he agrees with a lot of what Putin wants to do, maybe because he wants to do business in Moscow, I don\'t know the reasons. But we deserve answers. And we should demand that Donald release all of his tax returns so that people can see what are the entanglements and the financial relationships that he has... ', '10/9/16'),
('69', 'Raddatz', 'We\'re going to get to that later. Secretary Clinton, you\'re out of time. ', '10/9/16'),

('69', 'Raddatz', 'Mr. Trump?', '10/9/16'),
('69', 'Trump', 'Well, I think I should respond, because -- so ridiculous. Look, now she\'s blaming -- she got caught in a total lie. Her papers went out to all her friends at the banks, Goldman Sachs and everybody else, and she said things -- WikiLeaks that just came out. And she lied. Now she\'s blaming the lie on the late, great Abraham Lincoln. That\'s one that I haven\'t... ', '10/9/16'),
('69', 'Audience', '(LAUGHTER)', '10/9/16'),
('69', 'Trump', 'OK, Honest Abe, Honest Abe never lied. That\'s the good thing. That\'s the big difference between Abraham Lincoln and you. That\'s a big, big difference. We\'re talking about some difference. But as far as other elements of what she was saying, I don\'t know Putin. I think it would be great if we got along with Russia because we could fight ISIS together, as an example. But I don\'t know Putin. But I notice, anytime anything wrong happens, they like to say the Russians are -- she doesn\'t know if it\'s the Russians doing the hacking. Maybe there is no hacking. But they always blame Russia. And the reason they blame Russia because they think they\'re trying to tarnish me with Russia. I know nothing about Russia. I know -- I know about Russia, but I know nothing about the inner workings of Russia. I don\'t deal there. I have no businesses there. I have no loans from Russia. I have a very, very great balance sheet, so great that when I did the Old Post Office on Pennsylvania Avenue, the United States government, because of my balance sheet, which they actually know very well, chose me to do the Old Post Office, between the White House and Congress, chose me to do the Old Post Office. One of the primary area things, in fact, perhaps the primary thing was balance sheet. But I have no loans with Russia. You could go to the United States government, and they would probably tell you that, because they know my sheet very well in order to get that development I had to have. Now, the taxes are a very simple thing. As soon as I have -- first of all, I pay hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes. Many of her friends took bigger deductions. Warren Buffett took a massive deduction. Soros, who\'s a friend of hers, took a massive deduction. Many of the people that are giving her all this money that she can do many more commercials than me gave her -- took massive deductions. I pay hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes. But -- but as soon as my routine audit is finished, I\'ll release my returns. I\'ll be very proud to. They\'re actually quite great. ', '10/9/16'),
('69', 'Raddatz', 'Thank you, Mr. Trump. ', '10/9/16'),
('69', 'Cooper', 'We want to turn, actually, to the topic of taxes. We have a question from Spencer Maass. Spencer?', '10/9/16'),
('69', 'QUESTION', 'Good evening. My question is, what specific tax provisions will you change to ensure the wealthiest Americans pay their fair share in taxes? ', '10/9/16'),
('69', 'Cooper', 'Mr. Trump, you have two minutes. ', '10/9/16'),
('69', 'Trump', 'Well, one thing I\'d do is get rid of carried interest. One of the greatest provisions for people like me, to be honest with you, I give up a lot when I run, because I knock out the tax code. And she could have done this years ago, by the way. She\'s a United States -- she was a United States senator. She complains that Donald Trump took advantage of the tax code. Well, why didn\'t she change it? Why didn\'t you change it when you were a senator? The reason you didn\'t is that all your friends take the same advantage that I do. And I do. You have provisions in the tax code that, frankly, we could change. But you wouldn\'t change it, because all of these people gave you the money so you can take negative ads on Donald Trump. But -- and I say that about a lot of things. You know, I\'ve heard Hillary complaining about so many different things over the years. \"I wish you would have done this.\" But she\'s been there for 30 years she\'s been doing this stuff. She never changed. And she never will change. She never will change. We\'re getting rid of carried interest provisions. I\'m lowering taxes actually, because I think it\'s so important for corporations, because we have corporations leaving -- massive corporations and little ones, little ones can\'t form. We\'re getting rid of regulations which goes hand in hand with the lowering of the taxes. But we\'re bringing the tax rate down from 35 percent to 15 percent. We\'re cutting taxes for the middle class. And I will tell you, we are cutting them big league for the middle class. And I will tell you, Hillary Clinton is raising your taxes, folks. You can look at me. She\'s raising your taxes really high. And what that\'s going to do is a disaster for the country. But she is raising your taxes and I\'m lowering your taxes. That in itself is a big difference. We are going to be thriving again. We have no growth in this country. There\'s no growth. If China has a GDP of 7 percent, it\'s like a national catastrophe. We\'re down at 1 percent. And that\'s, like, no growth. And we\'re going lower, in my opinion. And a lot of it has to do with the fact that our taxes are so high, just about the highest in the world. And I\'m bringing them down to one of the lower in the world. And I think it\'s so important -- one of the most important things we can do. But she is raising everybody\'s taxes massively. ', '10/9/16'),
('69', 'Cooper', 'Secretary Clinton, you have two minutes. The question was, what specific tax provisions will you change to ensure the wealthiest Americans pay their fair share of taxes? ', '10/9/16'),
('69', 'Clinton', 'Well, everything you\'ve heard just now from Donald is not true. I\'m sorry I have to keep saying this, but he lives in an alternative reality. And it is sort of amusing to hear somebody who hasn\'t paid federal income taxes in maybe 20 years talking about what he\'s going to do. But I\'ll tell you what he\'s going to do. His plan will give the wealthy and corporations the biggest tax cuts they\'ve ever had, more than the Bush tax cuts by at least a factor of two. Donald always takes care of Donald and people like Donald, and this would be a massive gift. And, indeed, the way that he talks about his tax cuts would end up raising taxes on middle-class families, millions of middle-class families. Now, here\'s what I want to do. I have said nobody who makes less than $250,000 a year -- and that\'s the vast majority of Americans as you know -- will have their taxes raised, because I think we\'ve got to go where the money is. And the money is with people who have taken advantage of every single break in the tax code. And, yes, when I was a senator, I did vote to close corporate loopholes. I voted to close, I think, one of the loopholes he took advantage of when he claimed a billion-dollar loss that enabled him to avoid paying taxes. I want to have a tax on people who are making a million dollars. It\'s called the Buffett rule. Yes, Warren Buffett is the one who\'s gone out and said somebody like him should not be paying a lower tax rate than his secretary. I want to have a surcharge on incomes above $5 million. We have to make up for lost times, because I want to invest in you. I want to invest in hard-working families. And I think it\'s been unfortunate, but it\'s happened, that since the Great Recession, the gains have all gone to the top. And we need to reverse that. People like Donald, who paid zero in taxes, zero for our vets, zero for our military, zero for health and education, that is wrong. ', '10/9/16'),
('69', 'Cooper', 'Thank you, Secretary. ', '10/9/16'),
('69', 'Clinton', 'And we\'re going to make sure that nobody, no corporation, and no individual can get away without paying his fair share to support our country. ', '10/9/16'),
('69', 'Cooper', 'Thank you. I want to give you -- Mr. Trump, I want to give you the chance to respond. I just wanted to tell our viewers what she\'s referring to. In the last month, taxes were the number-one issue on Facebook for the first time in the campaign. The New York Times published three pages of your 1995 tax returns. They show you claimed a $916 million loss, which means you could have avoided paying personal federal income taxes for years. You\'ve said you pay state taxes, employee taxes, real estate taxes, property taxes. You have not answered, though, a simple question. Did you use that $916 million loss to avoid paying personal federal income taxes for years? ', '10/9/16'),
('69', 'Trump', 'Of course I do. Of course I do. And so do all of her donors, or most of her donors. I know many of her donors. Her donors took massive tax write-offs. ', '10/9/16'),
('69', 'Cooper', 'So have you (inaudible) personal federal income tax?', '10/9/16'),
('69', 'Trump', 'A lot of my -- excuse me, Anderson -- a lot of my write- off was depreciation and other things that Hillary as a senator allowed. And she\'ll always allow it, because the people that give her all this money, they want it. That\'s why. See, I understand the tax code better than anybody that\'s ever run for president. Hillary Clinton -- and it\'s extremely complex -- Hillary Clinton has friends that want all of these provisions, including they want the carried interest provision, which is very important to Wall Street people. But they really want the carried interest provision, which I believe Hillary\'s leaving. Very interesting why she\'s leaving carried interest. But I will tell you that, number one, I pay tremendous numbers of taxes. I absolutely used it. And so did Warren Buffett and so did George Soros and so did many of the other people that Hillary is getting money from. Now, I won\'t mention their names, because they\'re rich, but they\'re not famous. So we won\'t make them famous. ', '10/9/16'),
('69', 'Cooper', 'So can you -- can you say how many years you have avoided paying personal federal income taxes?', '10/9/16'),
('69', 'Trump', 'No, but I pay tax, and I pay federal tax, too. But I have a write-off, a lot of it\'s depreciation, which is a wonderful charge. I love depreciation. You know, she\'s given it to us. Hey, if she had a problem -- for 30 years she\'s been doing this, Anderson. I say it all the time. She talks about health care. Why didn\'t she do something about it? She talks about taxes. Why didn\'t she do something about it? She doesn\'t do anything about anything other than talk. With her, it\'s all talk and no action. ', '10/9/16'),

I mean, her and Obama, whether you like it or not, the way they got out of Iraq, the vacuum they\'ve left, that\'s why ISIS formed in the first place. They started from that little area, and now they\'re in 32 different nations, Hillary. Congratulations. Great job. ', '10/9/16'),

('69', 'Clinton', 'You know, under our Constitution, presidents have something called veto power. Look, he has now said repeatedly, \"30 years this and 30 years that.\" So let me talk about my 30 years in public service. I\'m very glad to do so. Eight million kids every year have health insurance, because when I was first lady I worked with Democrats and Republicans to create the Children\'s Health Insurance Program. Hundreds of thousands of kids now have a chance to be adopted because I worked to change our adoption and foster care system. After 9/11, I went to work with Republican mayor, governor and president to rebuild New York and to get health care for our first responders who were suffering because they had run toward danger and gotten sickened by it. Hundreds of thousands of National Guard and Reserve members have health care because of work that I did, and children have safer medicines because I was able to pass a law that required the dosing to be more carefully done. When I was secretary of state, I went around the world advocating for our country, but also advocating for women\'s rights, to make sure that women had a decent chance to have a better life and negotiated a treaty with Russia to lower nuclear weapons. Four hundred pieces of legislation have my name on it as a sponsor or cosponsor when I was a senator for eight years. I worked very hard and was very proud to be re-elected in New York by an even bigger margin than I had been elected the first time. And as president, I will take that work, that bipartisan work, that finding common ground, because you have to be able to get along with people to get things done in Washington. ', '10/9/16'),

('69', 'Raddatz', 'Mr. Trump, we\'re going to move on. The heart-breaking video of a 5-year-old Syrian boy named Omran sitting in an ambulance after being pulled from the rubble after an air strike in Aleppo focused the world\'s attention on the horrors of the war in Syria, with 136 million views on Facebook alone. But there are much worse images coming out of Aleppo every day now, where in the past few weeks alone, 400 people have been killed, at least 100 of them children. Just days ago, the State Department called for a war crimes investigation of the Syrian regime of Bashar al-Assad and its ally, Russia, for their bombardment of Aleppo. So this next question comes through social media through Facebook. Diane from Pennsylvania asks, if you were president, what would you do about Syria and the humanitarian crisis in Aleppo? Isn\'t it a lot like the Holocaust when the U.S. waited too long before we helped? Secretary Clinton, we will begin with your two minutes. ', '10/9/16'),
('69', 'Clinton', 'Well, the situation in Syria is catastrophic. And every day that goes by, we see the results of the regime by Assad in partnership with the Iranians on the ground, the Russians in the air, bombarding places, in particular Aleppo, where there are hundreds of thousands of people, probably about 250,000 still left. And there is a determined effort by the Russian air force to destroy Aleppo in order to eliminate the last of the Syrian rebels who are really holding out against the Assad regime. Russia hasn\'t paid any attention to ISIS. They\'re interested in keeping Assad in power. So I, when I was secretary of state, advocated and I advocate today a no-fly zone and safe zones. We need some leverage with the Russians, because they are not going to come to the negotiating table for a diplomatic resolution, unless there is some leverage over them. And we have to work more closely with our partners and allies on the ground. But I want to emphasize that what is at stake here is the ambitions and the aggressiveness of Russia. Russia has decided that it\'s all in, in Syria. And they\'ve also decided who they want to see become president of the United States, too, and it\'s not me. I\'ve stood up to Russia. I\'ve taken on Putin and others, and I would do that as president. I think wherever we can cooperate with Russia, that\'s fine. And I did as secretary of state. That\'s how we got a treaty reducing nuclear weapons. It\'s how we got the sanctions on Iran that put a lid on the Iranian nuclear program without firing a single shot. So I would go to the negotiating table with more leverage than we have now. But I do support the effort to investigate for crimes, war crimes committed by the Syrians and the Russians and try to hold them accountable. ', '10/9/16'),

Obama draws the line in the sand. It was laughed at all over the world what happened. Now, with that being said, she talks tough against Russia. But our nuclear program has fallen way behind, and they\'ve gone wild with their nuclear program. Not good. Our government shouldn\'t have allowed that to happen. Russia is new in terms of nuclear. We are old. We\'re tired. We\'re exhausted in terms of nuclear. A very bad thing. Now, she talks tough, she talks really tough against Putin and against Assad. She talks in favor of the rebels. She doesn\'t even know who the rebels are. You know, every time we take rebels, whether it\'s in Iraq or anywhere else, we\'re arming people. And you know what happens? They end up being worse than the people. Look at what she did in Libya with Gadhafi. Gadhafi\'s out. It\'s a mess. And, by the way, ISIS has a good chunk of their oil. I\'m sure you probably have heard that. It was a disaster. Because the fact is, almost everything she\'s done in foreign policy has been a mistake and it\'s been a disaster. But if you look at Russia, just take a look at Russia, and look at what they did this week, where I agree, she wasn\'t there, but possibly she\'s consulted. We sign a peace treaty. Everyone\'s all excited. Well, what Russia did with Assad and, by the way, with Iran, who you made very powerful with the dumbest deal perhaps I\'ve ever seen in the history of deal-making, the Iran deal, with the $150 billion, with the $1.7 billion in cash, which is enough to fill up this room. But look at that deal. Iran now and Russia are now against us. So she wants to fight. She wants to fight for rebels. There\'s only one problem. You don\'t even know who the rebels are.

I would specifically target Baghdadi, because I think our targeting of Al Qaida leaders -- and I was involved in a lot of those operations, highly classified ones -- made a difference.

But she\'s lied about a lot of things. ', '10/9/16'),

You go into the inner cities and -- you see it\'s 45 percent poverty. African- Americans now 45 percent poverty in the inner cities. The education is a disaster. Jobs are essentially nonexistent. I mean, it\'s -- you know, and I\'ve been saying at big speeches where I have 20,000 and 30,000 people, what do you have to lose? It can\'t get any worse. And she\'s been talking about the inner cities for 25 years. Nothing\'s going to ever happen. Let me tell you, if she\'s president of the United States, nothing\'s going to happen. It\'s just going to be talk. And all of her friends, the taxes we were talking about, and I would just get it by osmosis. She\'s not doing any me favors.

Mr. Carter, I have tried my entire life to do what I can to support children and families. You know, right out of law school, I went to work for the Children\'s Defense Fund. And Donald talks a lot about, you know, the 30 years I\'ve been in public service. I\'m proud of that. You know, I started off as a young lawyer working against discrimination against African-American children in schools and in the criminal justice system. I worked to make sure that kids with disabilities could get a public education, something that I care very much about. I have worked with Latinos -- one of my first jobs in politics was down in south Texas registering Latino citizens to be able to vote. So I have a deep devotion, to use your absolutely correct word, to making sure that an every American feels like he or she has a place in our country. And I think when you look at the letters that I get, a lot of people are worried that maybe they wouldn\'t have a place in Donald Trump\'s America. They write me, and one woman wrote me about her son, Felix. She adopted him from Ethiopia when he was a toddler. He\'s 10 years old now. This is the only one country he\'s ever known. And he listens to Donald on TV and he said to his mother one day, will he send me back to Ethiopia if he gets elected? You know, children listen to what is being said. To go back to the very, very first question. And there\'s a lot of fear -- in fact, teachers and parents are calling it the Trump effect. Bullying is up. A lot of people are feeling, you know, uneasy. A lot of kids are expressing their concerns. So, first and foremost, I will do everything I can to reach out to everybody. ', '10/9/16'),

You said that half of Donald Trump\'s supporters are, quote, \"deplorables, racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamophobic.\" You later said you regretted saying half. You didn\'t express regret for using the term \"deplorables.\" To Mr. Carter\'s question, how can you unite a country if you\'ve written off tens of millions of Americans? ', '10/9/16'),
('69', 'Clinton', 'Well, within hours I said that I was sorry about the way I talked about that, because my argument is not with his supporters. It\'s with him and with the hateful and divisive campaign that he has run, and the inciting of violence at his rallies, and the very brutal kinds of comments about not just women, but all Americans, all kinds of Americans. And what he has said about African-Americans and Latinos, about Muslims, about POWs, about immigrants, about people with disabilities, he\'s never apologized for. And so I do think that a lot of the tone and tenor that he has said -- I\'m proud of the campaign that Bernie Sanders and I ran. We ran a campaign based on issues, not insults.

We have a divided nation, because people like her -- and believe me, she has tremendous hate in her heart. And when she said deplorables, she meant it. And when she said irredeemable, they\'re irredeemable, you didn\'t mention that, but when she said they\'re irredeemable, to me that might have been even worse. ', '10/9/16'),

You said, if a leader doesn\'t have it, quote, \"he or she won\'t be one for very long.\" In the days after the first debate, you sent out a series of tweets from 3 a.m. to 5 a.m., including one that told people to check out a sex tape. Is that the discipline of a good leader? ', '10/9/16'),

Who\'s going -- the famous thing, we\'re going to answer our call at 3 o\'clock in the morning. Guess what happened? Ambassador Stevens -- Ambassador Stevens sent 600 requests for help. And the only one she talked to was Sidney Blumenthal, who\'s her friend and not a good guy, by the way. So, you know, she shouldn\'t be talking about that. Now, tweeting happens to be a modern day form of communication. I mean, you can like it or not like it. I have, between Facebook and Twitter, I have almost 25 million people. It\'s a very effective way of communication. So you can put it down, but it is a very effective form of communication. I\'m not un-proud of it, to be honest with you. ', '10/9/16'),

Everybody. African-American incomes went up 33 percent. And it\'s not just because I worked with George W. Bush after 9/11, and I was very proud that when I told him what the city needed, what we needed to recover, he said you\'ve got it, and he never wavered. He stuck with me.

('69', 'Raddatz', 'We begin with your two minutes, Secretary Clinton. ', '10/9/16'),
('69', 'Clinton', 'Thank you. Well, you\'re right. This is one of the most important issues in this election. I want to appoint Supreme Court justices who understand the way the world really works, who have real-life experience, who have not just been in a big law firm and maybe clerked for a judge and then gotten on the bench, but, you know, maybe they tried some more cases, they actually understand what people are up against. Because I think the current court has gone in the wrong direction. And so I would want to see the Supreme Court reverse Citizens United and get dark, unaccountable money out of our politics. Donald doesn\'t agree with that. I would like the Supreme Court to understand that voting rights are still a big problem in many parts of our country, that we don\'t always do everything we can to make it possible for people of color and older people and young people to be able to exercise their franchise. I want a Supreme Court that will stick with Roe v. Wade and a woman\'s right to choose, and I want a Supreme Court that will stick with marriage equality. Now, Donald has put forth the names of some people that he would consider. And among the ones that he has suggested are people who would reverse Roe v. Wade and reverse marriage equality. I think that would be a terrible mistake and would take us backwards. I want a Supreme Court that doesn\'t always side with corporate interests. I want a Supreme Court that understands because you\'re wealthy and you can give more money to something doesn\'t mean you have any more rights or should have any more rights than anybody else. So I have very clear views about what I want to see to kind of change the balance on the Supreme Court. And I regret deeply that the Senate has not done its job and they have not permitted a vote on the person that President Obama, a highly qualified person, they\'ve not given him a vote to be able to be have the full complement of nine Supreme Court justices. I think that was a dereliction of duty. I hope that they will see their way to doing it, but if I am so fortunate enough as to be president, I will immediately move to make sure that we fill that, we have nine justices that get to work on behalf of our people.

('69', 'Trump', 'Justice Scalia, great judge, died recently. And we have a vacancy. I am looking to appoint judges very much in the mold of Justice Scalia. I\'m looking for judges -- and I\'ve actually picked 20 of them so that people would see, highly respected, highly thought of, and actually very beautifully reviewed by just about everybody. But people that will respect the Constitution of the United States. And I think that this is so important. Also, the Second Amendment, which is totally under siege by people like Hillary Clinton. They\'ll respect the Second Amendment and what it stands for, what it represents. So important to me. Now, Hillary mentioned something about contributions just so you understand. So I will have in my race more than $100 million put in -- of my money, meaning I\'m not taking all of this big money from all of these different corporations like she\'s doing. What I ask is this. So I\'m putting in more than -- by the time it\'s finished, I\'ll have more than $100 million invested. Pretty much self-funding money. We\'re raising money for the Republican Party, and we\'re doing tremendously on the small donations, $61 average or so. I ask Hillary, why doesn\'t -- she made $250 million by being in office. She used the power of her office to make a lot of money. Why isn\'t she funding, not for $100 million, but why don\'t you put $10 million or $20 million or $25 million or $30 million into your own campaign? It\'s $30 million less for special interests that will tell you exactly what to do and it would really, I think, be a nice sign to the American public. Why aren\'t you putting some money in? You have a lot of it. You\'ve made a lot of it because of the fact that you\'ve been in office. Made a lot of it while you were secretary of state, actually. So why aren\'t you putting money into your own campaign? I\'m just curious. ', '10/9/16'),

('69', 'Cooper', 'Mr. Trump, two minutes? ', '10/9/16'),
('69', 'Trump', 'Absolutely. I think it\'s such a great question, because energy is under siege by the Obama administration. Under absolutely siege. The EPA, Environmental Protection Agency, is killing these energy companies. And foreign companies are now coming in buying our -- buying so many of our different plants and then re-jiggering the plant so that they can take care of their oil. We are killing -- absolutely killing our energy business in this country. Now, I\'m all for alternative forms of energy, including wind, including solar, et cetera. But we need much more than wind and solar. And you look at our miners. Hillary Clinton wants to put all the miners out of business. There is a thing called clean coal. Coal will last for 1,000 years in this country. Now we have natural gas and so many other things because of technology. We have unbelievable -- we have found over the last seven years, we have found tremendous wealth right under our feet. So good. Especially when you have $20 trillion in debt. I will bring our energy companies back. They\'ll be able to compete. They\'ll make money. They\'ll pay off our national debt. They\'ll pay off our tremendous budget deficits, which are tremendous. But we are putting our energy companies out of business. We have to bring back our workers. You take a look at what\'s happening to steel and the cost of steel and China dumping vast amounts of steel all over the United States, which essentially is killing our steelworkers and our steel companies. We have to guard our energy companies. We have to make it possible. The EPA is so restrictive that they are putting our energy companies out of business. And all you have to do is go to a great place like West Virginia or places like Ohio, which is phenomenal, or places like Pennsylvania and you see what they\'re doing to the people, miners and others in the energy business. It\'s a disgrace. ', '10/9/16'),

('69', 'Cooper', 'Secretary Clinton, two minutes. ', '10/9/16'),
('69', 'Clinton', 'And actually -- well, that was very interesting. First of all, China is illegally dumping steel in the United States and Donald Trump is buying it to build his buildings, putting steelworkers and American steel plants out of business. That\'s something that I fought against as a senator and that I would have a trade prosecutor to make sure that we don\'t get taken advantage of by China on steel or anything else. You know, because it sounds like you\'re in the business or you\'re aware of people in the business -- you know that we are now for the first time ever energy-independent. We are not dependent upon the Middle East. But the Middle East still controls a lot of the prices. So the price of oil has been way down. And that has had a damaging effect on a lot of the oil companies, right? We are, however, producing a lot of natural gas, which serves as a bridge to more renewable fuels. And I think that\'s an important transition. We\'ve got to remain energy-independent. It gives us much more power and freedom than to be worried about what goes on in the Middle East. We have enough worries over there without having to worry about that. So I have a comprehensive energy policy, but it really does include fighting climate change, because I think that is a serious problem. And I support moving toward more clean, renewable energy as quickly as we can, because I think we can be the 21st century clean energy superpower and create millions of new jobs and businesses. But I also want to be sure that we don\'t leave people behind. That\'s why I\'m the only candidate from the very beginning of this campaign who had a plan to help us revitalize coal country, because those coal miners and their fathers and their grandfathers, they dug that coal out. A lot of them lost their lives. They were injured, but they turned the lights on and they powered their factories. I don\'t want to walk away from them. So we\'ve got to do something for them.

His children are incredibly able and devoted, and I think that says a lot about Donald. I don\'t agree with nearly anything else he says or does, but I do respect that. And I think that is something that as a mother and a grandmother is very important to me. So I believe that this election has become in part so -- so conflict-oriented, so intense because there\'s a lot at stake. This is not an ordinary time, and this is not an ordinary election. We are going to be choosing a president who will set policy for not just four or eight years, but because of some of the important decisions we have to make here at home and around the world, from the Supreme Court to energy and so much else, and so there is a lot at stake. It\'s one of the most consequential elections that we\'ve had. And that\'s why I\'ve tried to put forth specific policies and plans, trying to get it off of the personal and put it on to what it is I want to do as president. And that\'s why I hope people will check on that for themselves so that they can see that, yes, I\'ve spent 30 years, actually maybe a little more, working to help kids and families.

And they\'ve done a wonderful job, and they\'ve been wonderful, wonderful kids. So I consider that a compliment. I will say this about Hillary. She doesn\'t quit. She doesn\'t give up. I respect that. I tell it like it is. She\'s a fighter. I disagree with much of what she\'s fighting for. I do disagree with her judgment in many cases. But she does fight hard, and she doesn\'t quit, and she doesn\'t give up. And I consider that to be a very good trait. ', '10/9/16'),

You have two minutes. ', '10/19/2016'),
('69', 'Clinton', 'Thank you very much, Chris. And thanks to UNLV for hosting us. You know, I think when we talk about the Supreme Court, it really raises the central issue in this election, namely, what kind of country are we going to be? What kind of opportunities will we provide for our citizens? What kind of rights will Americans have? And I feel strongly that the Supreme Court needs to stand on the side of the American people, not on the side of the powerful corporations and the wealthy. For me, that means that we need a Supreme Court that will stand up on behalf of women\'s rights, on behalf of the rights of the LGBT community, that will stand up and say no to Citizens United, a decision that has undermined the election system in our country because of the way it permits dark, unaccountable money to come into our electoral system. I have major disagreements with my opponent about these issues and others that will be before the Supreme Court. But I feel that at this point in our country\'s history, it is important that we not reverse marriage equality, that we not reverse Roe v. Wade, that we stand up against Citizens United, we stand up for the rights of people in the workplace, that we stand up and basically say: The Supreme Court should represent all of us. That\'s how I see the court, and the kind of people that I would be looking to nominate to the court would be in the great tradition of standing up to the powerful, standing up on behalf of our rights as Americans. And I look forward to having that opportunity. I would hope that the Senate would do its job and confirm the nominee that President Obama has sent to them. That\'s the way the Constitution fundamentally should operate. The president nominates, and then the Senate advises and consents, or not, but they go forward with the process. ', '10/19/2016'),
('69', 'Wallace', 'Secretary Clinton, thank you. ', '10/19/2016'),
('69', 'Wallace', 'Mr. Trump, same question. Where do you want to see the court take the country? And how do you believe the Constitution should be interpreted? ', '10/19/2016'),
('69', 'Trump', 'Well, first of all, it\'s great to be with you, and thank you, everybody. The Supreme Court: It\'s what it\'s all about. Our country is so, so -- it\'s just so imperative that we have the right justices. Something happened recently where Justice Ginsburg made some very, very inappropriate statements toward me and toward a tremendous number of people, many, many millions of people that I represent. And she was forced to apologize. And apologize she did. But these were statements that should never, ever have been made. We need a Supreme Court that in my opinion is going to uphold the Second Amendment, and all amendments, but the Second Amendment, which is under absolute siege. I believe if my opponent should win this race, which I truly don\'t think will happen, we will have a Second Amendment which will be a very, very small replica of what it is right now. But I feel that it\'s absolutely important that we uphold, because of the fact that it is under such trauma. I feel that the justices that I am going to appoint -- and I\'ve named 20 of them -- the justices that I\'m going to appoint will be pro-life. They will have a conservative bent. They will be protecting the Second Amendment. They are great scholars in all cases, and they\'re people of tremendous respect. They will interpret the Constitution the way the founders wanted it interpreted. And I believe that\'s very, very important. I don\'t think we should have justices appointed that decide what they want to hear. It\'s all about the Constitution of -- of -- and so important, the Constitution the way it was meant to be. And those are the people that I will appoint. ', '10/19/2016'),
('69', 'Wallace', 'Mr. Trump, thank you. ', '10/19/2016'),
('69', 'Wallace', 'We now have about 10 minutes for an open discussion. I want to focus on two issues that, in fact, by the justices that you name could end up changing the existing law of the land. First is one that you mentioned, Mr. Trump, and that is guns. Secretary Clinton, you said last year, let me quote, \"The Supreme Court is wrong on the Second Amendment.\" And now, in fact, in the 2008 Heller case, the court ruled that there is a constitutional right to bear arms, but a right that is reasonably limited. Those were the words of the Judge Antonin Scalia who wrote the decision. What\'s wrong with that? ', '10/19/2016'),
('69', 'Clinton', 'Well, first of all, I support the Second Amendment. I lived in Arkansas for 18 wonderful years. I represented upstate New York. I understand and respect the tradition of gun ownership. It goes back to the founding of our country. But I also believe that there can be and must be reasonable regulation. Because I support the Second Amendment doesn\'t mean that I want people who shouldn\'t have guns to be able to threaten you, kill you or members of your family. And so when I think about what we need to do, we have 33,000 people a year who die from guns. I think we need comprehensive background checks, need to close the online loophole, close the gun show loophole. There\'s other matters that I think are sensible that are the kind of reforms that would make a difference that are not in any way conflicting with the Second Amendment. You mentioned the Heller decision. And what I was saying that you referenced, Chris, was that I disagreed with the way the court applied the Second Amendment in that case, because what the District of Columbia was trying to do was to protect toddlers from guns and so they wanted people with guns to safely store them. And the court didn\'t accept that reasonable regulation, but they\'ve accepted many others. So I see no conflict between saving people\'s lives and defending the Second Amendment. ', '10/19/2016'),
('69', 'Wallace', 'Let me bring Mr. Trump in here. The bipartisan Open Debate Coalition got millions of votes on questions to ask here, and this was, in fact, one of the top questions that they got. How will you ensure the Second Amendment is protected? You just heard Secretary Clinton\'s answer. Does she persuade you that, while you may disagree on regulation, that, in fact, she supports a Second Amendment right to bear arms? ', '10/19/2016'),
('69', 'Trump', 'Well, the D.C. vs. Heller decision was very strongly -- and she was extremely angry about it. I watched. I mean, she was very, very angry when upheld. And Justice Scalia was so involved. And it was a well-crafted decision. But Hillary was extremely upset, extremely angry. And people that believe in the Second Amendment and believe in it very strongly were very upset with what she had to say. ', '10/19/2016'),
('69', 'Wallace', 'Well, let me bring in Secretary Clinton. Were you extremely upset? ', '10/19/2016'),
('69', 'Clinton', 'Well, I was upset because, unfortunately, dozens of toddlers injure themselves, even kill people with guns, because, unfortunately, not everyone who has loaded guns in their homes takes appropriate precautions. But there\'s no doubt that I respect the Second Amendment, that I also believe there\'s an individual right to bear arms. That is not in conflict with sensible, commonsense regulation. And, you know, look, I understand that Donald\'s been strongly supported by the NRA. The gun lobby\'s on his side. They\'re running millions of dollars of ads against me. And I regret that, because what I would like to see is for people to come together and say: Of course we\'re going to protect and defend the Second Amendment. But we\'re going to do it in a way that tries to save some of these 33,000 lives that we lose every year. ', '10/19/2016'),
('69', 'Wallace', 'Let me bring Mr. Trump back into this, because, in fact, you oppose any limits on assault weapons, any limits on high- capacity magazines. You support a national right to carry law. Why, sir? ', '10/19/2016'),
('69', 'Trump', 'Well, let me just tell you before we go any further. In Chicago, which has the toughest gun laws in the United States, probably you could say by far, they have more gun violence than any other city. So we have the toughest laws, and you have tremendous gun violence. I am a very strong supporter of the Second Amendment. And I am -- I don\'t know if Hillary was saying it in a sarcastic manner, but I\'m very proud to have the endorsement of the NRA. And it\'s the earliest endorsement they\'ve ever given to anybody who ran for president. So I\'m very honored by all of that. We are going to appoint justices -- this is the best way to help the Second Amendment. We are going to appoint justices that will feel very strongly about the Second Amendment, that will not do damage to the Second Amendment. ', '10/19/2016'),
('69', 'Wallace', 'Well, let\'s pick up on another issue which divides you and the justices that whoever ends up winning this election appoints could have a dramatic effect there, and that\'s the issue of abortion. ', '10/19/2016'),
('69', 'Trump', 'Right.', '10/19/2016'),
('69', 'Wallace', 'Mr. Trump, you\'re pro-life. But I want to ask you specifically: Do you want the court, including the justices that you will name, to overturn Roe v. Wade, which includes -- in fact, states -- a woman\'s right to abortion? ', '10/19/2016'),
('69', 'Trump', 'Well, if that would happen, because I am pro-life, and I will be appointing pro-life judges, I would think that that will go back to the individual states. ', '10/19/2016'),
('69', 'Wallace', 'But I\'m asking you specifically. Would you like to...', '10/19/2016'),
('69', 'Trump', 'If they overturned it, it will go back to the states. ', '10/19/2016'),
('69', 'Wallace', 'But what I\'m asking you, sir, is, do you want to see the court overturn -- you just said you want to see the court protect the Second Amendment. Do you want to see the court overturn Roe v. Wade? ', '10/19/2016'),
('69', 'Trump', 'Well, if we put another two or perhaps three justice on, that\'s really what\'s going to be -- that will happen. And that\'ll happen automatically, in my opinion, because I am putting pro-life justices on the court. I will say this: It will go back to the states, and the states will then make a determination. ', '10/19/2016'),
('69', 'Wallace', 'Secretary Clinton?', '10/19/2016'),
('69', 'Clinton', 'Well, I strongly support Roe v. Wade, which guarantees a constitutional right to a woman to make the most intimate, most difficult, in many cases, decisions about her health care that one can imagine. And in this case, it\'s not only about Roe v. Wade. It is about what\'s happening right now in America. So many states are putting very stringent regulations on women that block them from exercising that choice to the extent that they are defunding Planned Parenthood, which, of course, provides all kinds of cancer screenings and other benefits for women in our country. Donald has said he\'s in favor of defunding Planned Parenthood. He even supported shutting the government down to defund Planned Parenthood. I will defend Planned Parenthood. I will defend Roe v. Wade, and I will defend women\'s rights to make their own health care decisions. ', '10/19/2016'),
('69', 'Wallace', 'Secretary Clinton...', '10/19/2016'),
('69', 'Clinton', 'And we have come too far to have that turned back now. And, indeed, he said women should be punished, that there should be some form of punishment for women who obtain abortions. And I could just not be more opposed to that kind of thinking. ', '10/19/2016'),
('69', 'Wallace', 'I\'m going to give you a chance to respond, but I want to ask you, Secretary Clinton, I want to explore how far you believe the right to abortion goes. You have been quoted as saying that the fetus has no constitutional rights. You also voted against a ban on late-term, partial-birth abortions. Why? ', '10/19/2016'),
('69', 'Clinton', 'Because Roe v. Wade very clearly sets out that there can be regulations on abortion so long as the life and the health of the mother are taken into account. And when I voted as a senator, I did not think that that was the case. The kinds of cases that fall at the end of pregnancy are often the most heartbreaking, painful decisions for families to make. I have met with women who toward the end of their pregnancy get the worst news one could get, that their health is in jeopardy if they continue to carry to term or that something terrible has happened or just been discovered about the pregnancy. I do not think the United States government should be stepping in and making those most personal of decisions. So you can regulate if you are doing so with the life and the health of the mother taken into account. ', '10/19/2016'),
('69', 'Wallace', 'Mr. Trump, your reaction? And particularly on this issue of late-term, partial-birth abortions. ', '10/19/2016'),
('69', 'Trump', 'Well, I think it\'s terrible. If you go with what Hillary is saying, in the ninth month, you can take the baby and rip the baby out of the womb of the mother just prior to the birth of the baby. Now, you can say that that\'s OK and Hillary can say that that\'s OK. But it\'s not OK with me, because based on what she\'s saying, and based on where she\'s going, and where she\'s been, you can take the baby and rip the baby out of the womb in the ninth month on the final day. And that\'s not acceptable. ', '10/19/2016'),
('69', 'Clinton', 'Well, that is not what happens in these cases. And using that kind of scare rhetoric is just terribly unfortunate. You should meet with some of the women that I have met with, women I have known over the course of my life. This is one of the worst possible choices that any woman and her family has to make. And I do not believe the government should be making it. You know, I\'ve had the great honor of traveling across the world on behalf of our country. I\'ve been to countries where governments either forced women to have abortions, like they used to do in China, or forced women to bear children, like they used to do in Romania. And I can tell you: The government has no business in the decisions that women make with their families in accordance with their faith, with medical advice. And I will stand up for that right. ', '10/19/2016'),
('69', 'Wallace', 'All right. But just briefly, I want to move on to another segment... ', '10/19/2016'),
('69', 'Trump', 'And, honestly, nobody has business doing what I just said, doing that, as late as one or two or three or four days prior to birth. Nobody has that. ', '10/19/2016'),
('69', 'Wallace', 'All right. Let\'s move on to the subject of immigration. And there is almost no issue that separates the two of you more than the issue of immigration. Actually, there are a lot of issues that separate the two of you. Mr. Trump, you want to build a wall. Secretary Clinton, you have offered no specific plan for how you want to secure our southern border. Mr. Trump, you are calling for major deportations. Secretary Clinton, you say that within your first 100 days as president you\'re going to offer a package that includes a pathway to citizenship. The question, really, is, why are you right and your opponent wrong? Mr. Trump, you go first in this segment. You have two minutes. ', '10/19/2016'),
('69', 'Trump', 'Well, first of all, she wants to give amnesty, which is a disaster and very unfair to all of the people that are waiting on line for many, many years. We need strong borders. In the audience tonight, we have four mothers of -- I mean, these are unbelievable people that I\'ve gotten to know over a period of years whose children have been killed, brutally killed by people that came into the country illegally. You have thousands of mothers and fathers and relatives all over the country. They\'re coming in illegally. Drugs are pouring in through the border. We have no country if we have no border. Hillary wants to give amnesty. She wants to have open borders. The border -- as you know, the Border Patrol agents, 16,500-plus ICE last week, endorsed me. First time they\'ve ever endorsed a candidate. It means their job is tougher. But they know what\'s going on. They know it better than anybody. They want strong borders. They feel we have to have strong borders. I was up in New Hampshire the other day. The biggest complaint they have -- it\'s with all of the problems going on in the world, many of the problems caused by Hillary Clinton and by Barack Obama. All of the problems -- the single biggest problem is heroin that pours across our southern border. It\'s just pouring and destroying their youth. It\'s poisoning the blood of their youth and plenty of other people. We have to have strong borders. We have to keep the drugs out of our country. We are -- right now, we\'re getting the drugs, they\'re getting the cash. We need strong borders. We need absolute -- we cannot give amnesty. Now, I want to build the wall. We need the wall. And the Border Patrol, ICE, they all want the wall. We stop the drugs. We shore up the border. One of my first acts will be to get all of the drug lords, all of the bad ones -- we have some bad, bad people in this country that have to go out. We\'re going to get them out; we\'re going to secure the border. And once the border is secured, at a later date, we\'ll make a determination as to the rest. But we have some bad hombres here, and we\'re going to get them out. ', '10/19/2016');

('69', 'Wallace', 'Mr. Trump, thank you. Same question to you, Secretary Clinton. Basically, why are you right and Mr. Trump is wrong? ', '10/19/2016'),
('69', 'Clinton', 'Well, as he was talking, I was thinking about a young girl I met here in Las Vegas, Carla, who is very worried that her parents might be deported, because she was born in this country but they were not. They work hard, they do everything they can to give her a good life. And you\'re right. I don\'t want to rip families apart. I don\'t want to be sending parents away from children. I don\'t want to see the deportation force that Donald has talked about in action in our country. We have 11 million undocumented people. They have 4 million American citizen children, 15 million people. He said as recently as a few weeks ago in Phoenix that every undocumented person would be subject to deportation. Now, here\'s what that means. It means you would have to have a massive law enforcement presence, where law enforcement officers would be going school to school, home to home, business to business, rounding up people who are undocumented. And we would then have to put them on trains, on buses to get them out of our country. I think that is an idea that is not in keeping with who we are as a nation. I think it\'s an idea that would rip our country apart. I have been for border security for years. I voted for border security in the United States Senate. And my comprehensive immigration reform plan of course includes border security. But I want to put our resources where I think they\'re most needed: Getting rid of any violent person. Anybody who should be deported, we should deport them. When it comes to the wall that Donald talks about building, he went to Mexico, he had a meeting with the Mexican president. Didn\'t even raise it. He choked and then got into a Twitter war because the Mexican president said we\'re not paying for that wall. So I think we are both a nation of immigrants and we are a nation of laws and that we can act accordingly. And that\'s why I\'m introducing comprehensive immigration reform within the first 100 days with the path to citizenship. ', '10/19/2016'),

('69', 'Trump', 'I think I should respond to that. First of all, I had a very good meeting with the president of Mexico. Very nice man. We will be doing very much better with Mexico on trade deals. Believe me. The NAFTA deal signed by her husband is one of the worst deals ever made of any kind, signed by anybody. It\'s a disaster. Hillary Clinton wanted the wall. Hillary Clinton fought for the wall in 2006 or thereabouts. Now, she never gets anything done, so naturally the wall wasn\'t built. But Hillary Clinton wanted the wall. ', '10/19/2016'),

But it is clear, when you look at what Donald has been proposing, he started his campaign bashing immigrants, calling Mexican immigrants rapists and criminals and drug dealers, that he has a very different view about what we should do to deal with immigrants. Now, what I am also arguing is that bringing undocumented immigrants out from the shadows, putting them into the formal economy will be good, because then employers can\'t exploit them and undercut Americans\' wages. And Donald knows a lot about this. He used undocumented labor to build the Trump Tower. He underpaid undocumented workers, and when they complained, he basically said what a lot of employers do: \"You complain, I\'ll get you deported.\" I want to get everybody out of the shadows, get the economy working, and not let employers like Donald exploit undocumented workers, which hurts them, but also hurts American workers.

As far as moving these people out and moving -- we either have a country or we don\'t. We\'re a country of laws. We either have a border or we don\'t. Now, you can come back in and you can become a citizen. But it\'s very unfair. We have millions of people that did it the right way. They\'re on line. They\'re waiting. We\'re going to speed up the process, big league, because it\'s very inefficient. But they\'re on line and they\'re waiting to become citizens.

You know, we trade more energy with our neighbors than we trade with the rest of the world combined. And I do want us to have an electric grid, an energy system that crosses borders. I think that would be a great benefit to us. But you are very clearly quoting from WikiLeaks. And what\'s really important about WikiLeaks is that the Russian government has engaged in espionage against Americans. They have hacked American websites, American accounts of private people, of institutions. Then they have given that information to WikiLeaks for the purpose of putting it on the Internet. This has come from the highest levels of the Russian government, clearly, from Putin himself, in an effort, as 17 of our intelligence agencies have confirmed, to influence our election.

Now we can talk about Putin. I don\'t know Putin. He said nice things about me. If we got along well, that would be good. If Russia and the United States got along well and went after ISIS, that would be good. He has no respect for her. He has no respect for our president. And I\'ll tell you what: We\'re in very serious trouble, because we have a country with tremendous numbers of nuclear warheads -- 1,800, by the way -- where they expanded and we didn\'t, 1,800 nuclear warheads.

There\'s about four minutes between the order being given and the people responsible for launching nuclear weapons to do so. And that\'s why 10 people who have had that awesome responsibility have come out and, in an unprecedented way, said they would not trust Donald Trump with the nuclear codes or to have his finger on the nuclear button.

In this round, you go first, Secretary Clinton. ', '10/19/2016'),
('69', 'Clinton', 'Well, I think when the middle class thrives, America thrives. And so my plan is based on growing the economy, giving middle-class families many more opportunities. I want us to have the biggest jobs program since World War II, jobs in infrastructure and advanced manufacturing. I think we can compete with high-wage countries, and I believe we should. New jobs and clean energy, not only to fight climate change, which is a serious problem, but to create new opportunities and new businesses. I want us to do more to help small business. That\'s where two- thirds of the new jobs are going to come from. I want us to raise the national minimum wage, because people who live in poverty should not -- who work full-time should not still be in poverty. And I sure do want to make sure women get equal pay for the work we do. I feel strongly that we have to have an education system that starts with preschool and goes through college. That\'s why I want more technical education in high schools and in community colleges, real apprenticeships to prepare young people for the jobs of the future. I want to make college debt-free and for families making less than $125,000, you will not get a tuition bill from a public college or university if the plan that I worked on with Bernie Sanders is enacted. And we\'re going to work hard to make sure that it is, because we are going to go where the money is. Most of the gains in the last years since the Great Recession have gone to the very top. So we are going to have the wealthy pay their fair share. We\'re going to have corporations make a contribution greater than they are now to our country. That is a plan that has been analyzed by independent experts which said that it could produce 10 million new jobs. By contrast, Donald\'s plan has been analyzed to conclude it might lose 3.5 million jobs. Why? Because his whole plan is to cut taxes, to give the biggest tax breaks ever to the wealthy and to corporations, adding $20 trillion to our debt, and causing the kind of dislocation that we have seen before, because it truly will be trickle-down economics on steroids. So the plan I have I think will actually produce greater opportunities. The plan he has will cost us jobs and possibly lead to another Great Recession. ', '10/19/2016'),
('69', 'Wallace', 'Secretary, thank you. Mr. Trump, why will your plan create more jobs and growth than Secretary Clinton\'s? ', '10/19/2016'),
('69', 'Trump', 'Well, first of all, before I start on my plan, her plan is going to raise taxes and even double your taxes. Her tax plan is a disaster. And she can say all she wants about college tuition. And I\'m a big proponent. We\'re going to do a lot of things for college tuition. But the rest of the public\'s going to be paying for it. We will have a massive, massive tax increase under Hillary Clinton\'s plan. ', '10/19/2016'),
('69', 'Trump', 'But I\'d like to start off where we left, because when I said Japan and Germany, and I\'m -- not to single them out, but South Korea, these are very rich, powerful countries. Saudi Arabia, nothing but money. We protect Saudi Arabia. Why aren\'t they paying? She immediately -- when she heard this, I questioned it, and I questioned NATO. Why aren\'t the NATO questioned -- why aren\'t they paying? Because they weren\'t paying. Since I did this -- this was a year ago -- all of a sudden, they\'re paying. And I\'ve been given a lot -- a lot of credit for it. All of a sudden, they\'re starting to pay up. They have to pay up. We\'re protecting people, they have to pay up. And I\'m a big fan of NATO. But they have to pay up. She comes out and said, we love our allies, we think our allies are great. Well, it\'s awfully hard to get them to pay up when you have somebody saying we think how great they are. We have to tell Japan in a very nice way, we have to tell Germany, all of these countries, South Korea, we have to say, you have to help us out. We have, during his regime, during President Obama\'s regime, we\'ve doubled our national debt. We\'re up to $20 trillion. So my plan -- we\'re going to renegotiate trade deals. We\'re going to have a lot of free trade. We\'re going to have free trade, more free trade than we have right now. But we have horrible deals. Our jobs are being taken out by the deal that her husband signed, NAFTA, one of the worst deals ever. Our jobs are being sucked out of our economy. You look at all of the places that I just left, you go to Pennsylvania, you go to Ohio, you go to Florida, you go to any of them. You go upstate New York. Our jobs have fled to Mexico and other places. We\'re bringing our jobs back. I am going to renegotiate NAFTA. And if I can\'t make a great deal -- then we\'re going to terminate NAFTA and we\'re going to create new deals. We\'re going to have trade, but we\'re going -- we\'re going to terminate it, we\'re going to make a great trade deal. And if we can\'t, we\'re going to do it -- we\'re going to go a separate way, because it has been a disaster. We are going to cut taxes massively. We\'re going to cut business taxes massively. They\'re going to start hiring people. We\'re going to bring the $2.5 trillion... ', '10/19/2016'),

('69', 'Clinton', '... the fact is, he\'s going to advocate for the largest tax cuts we\'ve ever seen, three times more than the tax cuts under the Bush administration. I have said repeatedly throughout this campaign: I will not raise taxes on anyone making $250,000 or less. I also will not add a penny to the debt. I have costed out what I\'m going to do. He will, through his massive tax cuts, add $20 trillion to the debt. Well, he mentioned the debt. We know how to get control of the debt. When my husband was president, we went from a $300 billion deficit to a $200 billion surplus and we were actually on the path to eliminating the national debt. When President Obama came into office, he inherited the worst economic disaster since the Great Depression. He has cut the deficit by two-thirds. So, yes, one of the ways you go after the debt, one of the ways you create jobs is by investing in people. So I do have investments, investments in new jobs, investments in education, skill training, and the opportunities for people to get ahead and stay ahead. That\'s the kind of approach that will work.

('69', 'Wallace', 'Secretary Clinton, I want to pursue your plan, because in many ways it is similar to the Obama stimulus plan in 2009, which has led to the slowest GDP growth since 1949. ', '10/19/2016'),
('69', 'Trump', 'Correct.', '10/19/2016'),
('69', 'Wallace', 'Thank you, sir. You told me in July when we spoke that the problem is that President Obama didn\'t get to do enough in what he was trying to do with his stimulus. So is your plan basically more -- even more of the Obama stimulus? ', '10/19/2016'),
('69', 'Clinton', 'Well, it\'s a combination, Chris. And let me say that when you inherit the level of economic catastrophe that President Obama inherited, it was a real touch-and-go situation. I was in the Senate before I became secretary of state. I\'ve never seen people as physically distraught as the Bush administration team was because of what was happening to the economy. I personally believe that the steps that President Obama took saved the economy. He doesn\'t get the credit he deserves for taking some very hard positions. But it was a terrible recession. So now we\'ve dug ourselves out of it, we\'re standing, but we\'re not yet running. So what I am proposing is that we invest from the middle out and the ground up, not the top down. That is not going to work. That\'s why what I have put forward doesn\'t add a penny to the debt, but it is the kind of approach that will enable more people to take those new jobs, higher-paying jobs. We\'re beginning to see some increase in incomes, and we certainly have had a long string of increasing jobs. We\'ve got to do more to get the whole economy moving, and that\'s what I believe I will be able to do. ', '10/19/2016'),

We are growing -- our last report came out -- and it\'s right around the 1 percent level. And I think it\'s going down. Last week, as you know, the end of last week, they came out with an anemic jobs report. A terrible jobs report. In fact I said, is that the last jobs report before the election? Because if it is, I should win easily, it was so bad. The report was so bad. Look, our country is stagnant. We\'ve lost our jobs. We\'ve lost our businesses. We\'re not making things anymore, relatively speaking. Our product is pouring in from China, pouring in from Vietnam, pouring in from all over the world. I\'ve visited so many communities. This has been such an incredible education for me, Chris. I\'ve gotten to know so many -- I\'ve developed so many friends over the last year. And they cry when they see what\'s happened. I pass factories that were thriving 20, 25 years ago, and because of the bill that her husband signed and she blessed 100 percent, it is just horrible what\'s happened to these people in these communities. Now, she can say that her husband did well, but, boy, did they suffer as NAFTA kicked in, because it didn\'t really kick in very much, but it kicked in after they left. Boy, did they suffer. That was one of the worst things that\'s ever been signed by our country. Now she wants to sign Trans-Pacific Partnership. And she wants it. She lied when she said she didn\'t call it the gold standard in one of the debates. She totally lied. She did call it the gold standard. And they actually fact checked, and they said I was right. I was so honored. ', '10/19/2016'),

There\'s only one of us on this stage who\'s actually shipped jobs to Mexico, because that\'s Donald. He\'s shipped jobs to 12 countries, including Mexico. But he mentioned China. And, you know, one of the biggest problems we have with China is the illegal dumping of steel and aluminum into our markets. I have fought against that as a senator. I\'ve stood up against it as secretary of state. Donald has bought Chinese steel and aluminum. In fact, the Trump Hotel right here in Las Vegas was made with Chinese steel.

He was getting sued by the Justice Department for racial discrimination in his apartment buildings. In the 1980s, I was working to reform the schools in Arkansas. He was borrowing $14 million from his father to start his businesses. In the 1990s, I went to Beijing and I said women\'s rights are human rights.

And if we could run our country the way I\'ve run my company, we would have a country that you would be so proud of. You would even be proud of it. And frankly, when you look at her real record, take a look at Syria. Take a look at the migration. Take a look at Libya. Take a look at Iraq. She gave us ISIS, because her and Obama created this huge vacuum, and a small group came out of that huge vacuum because when -- we should never have been in Iraq, but once we were there, we should have never got out the way they wanted to get out.

And since then, as we all know, nine women have come forward and have said that you either groped them or kissed them without their consent. Why would so many different women from so many different circumstances over so many different years, why would they all in this last couple of weeks make up -- you deny this -- why would they all make up these stories?

She\'s the one and Obama that caused the violence. They hired people -- they paid them $1,500, and they\'re on tape saying be violent, cause fights, do bad things. I would say the only way -- because those stories are all totally false, I have to say that. And I didn\'t even apologize to my wife, who\'s sitting right here, because I didn\'t do anything. I didn\'t know any of these -- I didn\'t see these women. These women -- the woman on the plane, the -- I think they want either fame or her campaign did it. And I think it\'s her campaign. Because what I saw what they did, which is a criminal act, by the way, where they\'re telling people to go out and start fist-fights and start violence. And I\'ll tell you what, in particular in Chicago, people were hurt and people could have been killed in that riot. And that was now all on tape, started by her. I believe, Chris, that she got these people to step forward. If it wasn\'t, they get their 10 minutes of fame. But they were all totally -- it was all fiction. It was lies, and it was fiction.

The Iraqi offensive to take back Mosul has begun. If they are successful in pushing ISIS out of that city and out of all of Iraq, the question then becomes, what happens the day after? And that\'s something that whichever of you ends up -- whoever of you ends up as president is going to have to confront.

But I will not support putting American soldiers into Iraq as an occupying force. I don\'t think that is in our interest, and I don\'t think that would be smart to do. In fact, Chris, I think that would be a big red flag waving for ISIS to reconstitute itself. The goal here is to take back Mosul. It\'s going to be a hard fight. I\'ve got no illusions about that. And then continue to press into Syria to begin to take back and move on Raqqa, which is the ISIS headquarters. I am hopeful that the hard work that American military advisers have done will pay off and that we will see a real -- a really successful military operation. But we know we\'ve got lots of work to do. Syria will remain a hotbed of terrorism as long as the civil war, aided and abetted by the Iranians and the Russians, continue. So I have said, look, we need to keep our eye on ISIS. That\'s why I want to have an intelligence surge that protects us here at home, why we have to go after them from the air, on the ground, online, why we have to make sure here at home we don\'t let terrorists buy weapons. If you\'re too dangerous to fly, you\'re too dangerous to buy a gun. And I\'m going to continue to push for a no-fly zone and safe havens within Syria not only to help protect the Syrians and prevent the constant outflow of refugees, but to, frankly, gain some leverage on both the Syrian government and the Russians so that perhaps we can have the kind of serious negotiation necessary to bring the conflict to an end and go forward on a political track.

('69', 'Trump', 'Let me tell you, Mosul is so sad. We had Mosul. But when she left, when she took everybody out, we lost Mosul. Now we\'re fighting again to get Mosul. The problem with Mosul and what they wanted to do is they wanted to get the leaders of ISIS who they felt were in Mosul. About three months ago, I started reading that they want to get the leaders and they\'re going to attack Mosul. Whatever happened to the element of surprise, OK? We announce we\'re going after Mosul. I have been reading about going after Mosul now for about -- how long is it, Hillary, three months? These people have all left. They\'ve all left. The element of surprise. Douglas MacArthur, George Patton spinning in their graves when they see the stupidity of our country. So we\'re now fighting for Mosul, that we had. All she had to do was stay there, and now we\'re going in to get it. But you know who the big winner in Mosul is going to be after we eventually get it? And the only reason they did it is because she\'s running for the office of president and they want to look tough. They want to look good. He violated the red line in the sand, and he made so many mistakes, made all the mistakes. That\'s why we have the great migration. But she wanted to look good for the election. So they\'re going in. But who\'s going to get Mosul, really? We\'ll take Mosul eventually. But the way -- if you look at what\'s happening, much tougher than they thought. Much, much tougher. Much more dangerous. Going to be more deaths that they thought. But the leaders that we wanted to get are all gone because they\'re smart. They say, what do we need this for? So Mosul is going to be a wonderful thing. And Iran should write us a letter of thank you, just like the really stupid -- the stupidest deal of all time, a deal that\'s going to give Iran absolutely nuclear weapons. Iran should write us yet another letter saying thank you very much, because Iran, as I said many years ago, Iran is taking over Iraq, something they\'ve wanted to do forever, but we\'ve made it so easy for them. So we\'re now going to take Mosul. And do you know who\'s going to be the beneficiary? Iran. Oh, yeah, they\'re making -- I mean, they are outsmarting -- look, you\'re not there, you might be involved in that decision. But you were there when you took everybody out of Mosul and out of Iraq.

Mosul is on the border of Syria. And, yes, we do need to go after Baghdadi, and -- just like we went after bin Laden, while you were doing \"Celebrity Apprentice,\" and we brought him to justice. We need to go after the leadership. But we need to get rid of them, get rid of their fighters. There are an estimated several thousand fighters in Mosul. They\'ve been digging underground. They\'ve been prepared to defend. It\'s going to be tough fighting. But I think we can take back Mosul, and then we can move on into Syria and take back Raqqa. This is what we have to do. I\'m just amazed that he seems to think that the Iraqi government and our allies and everybody else launched the attack on Mosul to help me in this election, but that\'s how Donald thinks.

('69', 'Trump', '... in many cases, ISIS-aligned, and we now have them in our country, and wait until you see -- this is going to be the great Trojan horse. And wait until you see what happens in the coming years. Lots of luck, Hillary. Thanks a lot for doing a great job. ', '10/19/2016'),
('69', 'Wallace', 'Secretary Clinton, you have talked about -- and in the last debate and again today -- that you would impose a no-fly zone to try to protect the people of Aleppo and to stop the killing there. President Obama has refused to do that because he fears it\'s going to draw us closer or deeper into the conflict. And General Joseph Dunford, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, says you impose a no-fly zone, chances are you\'re going to get into a war -- his words -- with Syria and Russia. So the question I have is, if you impose a no-fly zone -- first of all, how do you respond to their concerns? Secondly, if you impose a no-fly zone and a Russian plane violates that, does President Clinton shoot that plane down? ', '10/19/2016'),
('69', 'Clinton', 'Well, Chris, first of all, I think a no-fly zone could save lives and could hasten the end of the conflict. I\'m well aware of the really legitimate concerns that you have expressed from both the president and the general. This would not be done just on the first day. This would take a lot of negotiation. And it would also take making it clear to the Russians and the Syrians that our purpose here was to provide safe zones on the ground. We\'ve had millions of people leave Syria and those millions of people inside Syria who have been dislocated. So I think we could strike a deal and make it very clear to the Russians and the Syrians that this was something that we believe was in the best interests of the people on the ground in Syria, it would help us with our fight against ISIS. But I want to respond to what Donald said about refugees. He\'s made these claims repeatedly. I am not going to let anyone into this country who is not vetted, who we do not have confidence in. But I am not going to slam the door on women and children. That picture of that little 4-year-old boy in Aleppo, with the blood coming down his face while he sat in an ambulance, is haunting. And so we are going to do very careful, thorough vetting. That does not solve our internal challenges with ISIS and our need to stop radicalization, to work with American Muslim communities who are on the front lines to identify and prevent attacks. In fact, the killer of the dozens of people at the nightclub in Orlando, the Pulse nightclub, was born in Queens, the same place Donald was born. So let\'s be clear about what the threat is and how we are best going to be able to meet it. And, yes, some of that threat emanates from over in Syria and Iraq, and we\'ve got to keep fighting, and I will defeat ISIS, and some of it is we have to up our game and be much smarter here at home. ', '10/19/2016'),
('69', 'Wallace', 'Folks, I want to get into our final segment. ', '10/19/2016'),
('69', 'Trump', 'But I just have to...', '10/19/2016'),
('69', 'Wallace', 'Real quick.', '10/19/2016'),
('69', 'Trump', 'It\'s so ridiculous what she -- she will defeat ISIS. We should have never let ISIS happen in the first place. And right now, they\'re in 32 countries. ', '10/19/2016'),
('69', 'Wallace', 'OK.', '10/19/2016'),
('69', 'Trump', 'We should have -- wait one second. They had a cease-fire three weeks ago. A cease-fire, the United States, Russia, and Syria. And during the cease-fire, Russia took over vast swatches of land, and then they said we don\'t want the cease-fire anymore. We are so outplayed on missiles, on cease-fires. They are outplayed. Now, she wasn\'t there. I assume she had nothing to do with it. But our country is so outplayed by Putin and Assad, and by the way -- and by Iran. Nobody can believe how stupid our leadership is. ', '10/19/2016'),
('69', 'Wallace', 'Mr. Trump, Secretary Clinton -- no, we need to move on to our final segment, and that is the national debt, which has not been discussed until tonight. Our national debt, as a share of the economy, our GDP, is now 77 percent. That\'s the highest since just after World War II. But the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget says, Secretary Clinton, under your plan, debt would rise to 86 percent of GDP over the next 10 years. Mr. Trump, under your plan, they say it would rise to 105 percent of GDP over the next 10 years. The question is, why are both of you ignoring this problem? Mr. Trump, you go first. ', '10/19/2016'),
('69', 'Trump', 'Well, I say they\'re wrong, because I\'m going to create tremendous jobs. And we\'re bringing GDP from, really, 1 percent, which is what it is now, and if she got in, it will be less than zero. But we\'re bringing it from 1 percent up to 4 percent. And I actually think we can go higher than 4 percent. I think you can go to 5 percent or 6 percent. And if we do, you don\'t have to bother asking your question, because we have a tremendous machine. We will have created a tremendous economic machine once again. To do that, we\'re taking back jobs. We\'re not going to let our companies be raided by other countries where we lose all our jobs, we don\'t make our product anymore. It\'s very sad. But I\'m going to create a -- the kind of a country that we were from the standpoint of industry. We used to be there. We\'ve given it up. We\'ve become very, very sloppy. We\'ve had people that are political hacks making the biggest deals in the world, bigger than companies. You take these big companies, these trade deals are far bigger than these companies, and yet we don\'t use our great leaders, many of whom back me and many of whom back Hillary, I must say. But we don\'t use those people. Those are the people -- these are the greatest negotiators in the world. We have the greatest businesspeople in the world. We have to use them to negotiate our trade deals. We use political hacks. We use people that get the position because they gave -- they made a campaign contribution and they\'re dealing with China and people that are very much smarter than they are. So we have to use our great people. But that being said, we will create an economic machine the likes of which we haven\'t seen in many decades. And people, Chris, will again go back to work and they\'ll make a lot of money. And we\'ll have companies that will grow and expand and start from new. ', '10/19/2016'),
('69', 'Wallace', 'Secretary Clinton?', '10/19/2016'),
('69', 'Clinton', 'Well, first, when I hear Donald talk like that and know that his slogan is \"Make America Great Again,\" I wonder when he thought America was great. And before he rushes and says, \"You know, before you and President Obama were there,\" I think it\'s important to recognize that he has been criticizing our government for decades. You know, back in 1987, he took out a $100,000 ad in the New York Times, during the time when President Reagan was president, and basically said exactly what he just said now, that we were the laughingstock of the world. He was criticizing President Reagan. This is the way Donald thinks about himself, puts himself into, you know, the middle and says, \"You know, I alone can fix it,\" as he said on the convention stage. But if you look at the debt, which is the issue you asked about, Chris, I pay for everything I\'m proposing. I do not add a penny to the national debt. I take that very seriously, because I do think it\'s one of the issues we\'ve got to come to grips with. So when I talk about how we\'re going to pay for education, how we\'re going to invest in infrastructure, how we\'re going to get the cost of prescription drugs down, and a lot of the other issues that people talk to me about all the time, I\'ve made it very clear we are going where the money is. We are going to ask the wealthy and corporations to pay their fair share. And there is no evidence whatsoever that that will slow down or diminish our growth. In fact, I think just the opposite. We\'ll have what economists call middle-out growth. We\'ve got to get back to rebuilding the middle class, the families of America. That\'s where growth will come from. That\'s why I want to invest in you. I want to invest in your family. And I think that\'s the smartest way to grow the economy, to make the economy fairer. And we just have a big disagreement about this. It may be because of our experiences. You know, he started off with his dad as a millionaire... ', '10/19/2016'),
('69', 'Trump', 'Yeah, yeah, we\'ve heard -- we\'ve heard this before, Hillary. ', '10/19/2016'),
('69', 'Clinton', 'I started off with -- my dad was a small-business man.', '10/19/2016'),
('69', 'Trump', 'We\'ve heard this before.', '10/19/2016'),
('69', 'Clinton', 'And I think it -- you know, it\'s a difference that affects how we see the world and what we want to do with the economy. ', '10/19/2016'),
('69', 'Wallace', 'Time.', '10/19/2016'),
('69', 'Trump', 'Thank you, Hillary. Could I just respond? ', '10/19/2016'),
('69', 'Wallace', 'Well, no, sir, because we\'re running out of time... ', '10/19/2016'),
('69', 'Trump', 'Because I did disagree with Ronald Reagan very strongly on trade. I disagreed with him. We should have been much tougher on trade even then. I\'ve been waiting for years. Nobody does it right.', '10/19/2016'),
('69', 'Wallace', 'OK.', '10/19/2016'),
('69', 'Trump', 'And frankly, now we\'re going to do it right. ', '10/19/2016'),
('69', 'Wallace', 'All right. The one last area I want to get into with you in this debate is the fact that the biggest driver of our debt is entitlements, which is 60 percent of all federal spending. Now, the Committee for federal -- a Responsible Federal Budget has looked at both of your plans and they say neither of you has a serious plan that is going to solve the fact that Medicare\'s going to run out of money in the 2020s, Social Security is going to run out of money in the 2030s, and at that time, recipients are going to take huge cuts in their benefits. So, in effect, the final question I want to ask you in this regard is -- and let me start with you, Mr. Trump, would President Trump make a deal to save Medicare and Social Security that included both tax increases and benefit cuts, in effect, a grand bargain on entitlements? ', '10/19/2016'),
('69', 'Trump', 'I\'m cutting taxes. We\'re going to grow the economy. It\'s going to grow at a record rate of growth.', '10/19/2016'),
('69', 'Wallace', 'That\'s not going to help in the entitlements.', '10/19/2016'),
('69', 'Trump', 'No, it\'s going to totally help you. And one thing we have to do: Repeal and replace the disaster known as Obamacare. It\'s destroying our country. It\'s destroying our businesses, our small business and our big businesses. We have to repeal and replace Obamacare. You take a look at the kind of numbers that that will cost us in the year \'17, it is a disaster. If we don\'t repeal and replace -- now, it\'s probably going to die of its own weight. But Obamacare has to go. It\'s -- the premiums are going up 60 percent, 70 percent, 80 percent. Next year they\'re going to go up over 100 percent. And I\'m really glad that the premiums have started -- at least the people see what\'s happening, because she wants to keep Obamacare and she wants to make it even worse, and it can\'t get any worse. Bad health care at the most expensive price. We have to repeal and replace Obamacare. ', '10/19/2016'),
('69', 'Wallace', 'And, Secretary Clinton, same question, because at this point, Social Security and Medicare are going to run out, the trust funds are going to run out of money. Will you as president entertain -- will you consider a grand bargain, a deal that includes both tax increases and benefit cuts to try to save both programs? ', '10/19/2016'),
('69', 'Clinton', 'Well, Chris, I am on record as saying that we need to put more money into the Social Security Trust Fund. That\'s part of my commitment to raise taxes on the wealthy. My Social Security payroll contribution will go up, as will Donald\'s, assuming he can\'t figure out how to get out of it. But what we want to do is to replenish the Social Security Trust Fund... ', '10/19/2016'),
('69', 'Trump', 'Such a nasty woman.', '10/19/2016'),
('69', 'Clinton', '... by making sure that we have sufficient resources, and that will come from either raising the cap and/or finding other ways to get more money into it. I will not cut benefits. I want to enhance benefits for low-income workers and for women who have been disadvantaged by the current Social Security system. But what Donald is proposing with these massive tax cuts will result in a $20 trillion additional national debt. That will have dire consequences for Social Security and Medicare. And I\'ll say something about the Affordable Care Act, which he wants to repeal. The Affordable Care Act extended the solvency of the Medicare Trust Fund. So if repeals it, our Medicare problem gets worse. What we need to do is go after... ', '10/19/2016'),
('69', 'Trump', 'Your husband disagrees with you.', '10/19/2016'),
('69', 'Clinton', '... the long-term health care drivers. We\'ve got to get costs down, increase value, emphasize wellness. I have a plan for doing that. And I think that we will be able to get entitlement spending under control by with more resources and harder decisions. ', '10/19/2016'),
('69', 'Wallace', 'This is -- this is the final time, probably to both of your delight, that you\'re going to be on a stage together in this campaign. I would like to end it on a positive note. You had not agreed to closing statements, but it seems to me in a funny way that might make it more interesting because you haven\'t prepared closing statements. So I\'d like you each to take -- and we\'re going to put a clock up, a minute, as the final question in the final debate, to tell the American people why they should elect you to be the next president. This is another new mini-segment. Secretary Clinton, it\'s your turn to go first. ', '10/19/2016'),
('69', 'Clinton', 'Well, I would like to say to everyone watching tonight that I\'m reaching out to all Americans -- Democrats, Republicans, and independents -- because we need everybody to help make our country what it should be, to grow the economy, to make it fairer, to make it work for everyone. We need your talents, your skills, your commitments, your energy, your ambition. You know, I\'ve been privileged to see the presidency up close. And I know the awesome responsibility of protecting our country and the incredible opportunity of working to try to make life better for all of you. I have made the cause of children and families really my life\'s work. That\'s what my mission will be in the presidency. I will stand up for families against powerful interests, against corporations. I will do everything that I can to make sure that you have good jobs, with rising incomes, that your kids have good educations from preschool through college. I hope you will give me a chance to serve as your president. ', '10/19/2016'),
('69', 'Wallace', 'Secretary Clinton, thank you. Mr. Trump? ', '10/19/2016'),
('69', 'Trump', 'She\'s raising the money from the people she wants to control. Doesn\'t work that way. But when I started this campaign, I started it very strongly. It\'s called \"Make America Great Again.\" We\'re going to make America great. We have a depleted military. It has to be helped, has to be fixed. We have the greatest people on Earth in our military. We don\'t take care of our veterans. We take care of illegal immigrants, people that come into the country illegally, better than we take care of our vets. That can\'t happen. Our policemen and women are disrespected. We need law and order, but we need justice, too. Our inner cities are a disaster. You get shot walking to the store. They have no education. They have no jobs. I will do more for African-Americans and Latinos than she can ever do in 10 lifetimes. All she\'s done is talk to the African-Americans and to the Latinos, but they get the vote, and then they come back, they say, we\'ll see you in four years. We are going to make America strong again, and we are going to make America great again, and it has to start now. We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that\'s what you get when you get her. ', '10/19/2016'),

('69', 'Audience', '(APPLAUSE)', '10/19/2016'),
('69', 'Wallace', 'Secretary Clinton -- hold on just a moment, folks. Secretary Clinton, Mr. Trump, I want to thank you both for participating in all three of these debates. That brings to an end this year\'s debates sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates. We want to thank the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, and its students for having us. Now the decision is up to you. While millions have already voted, Election Day, November 8th, is just 20 days away. One thing everyone here can agree on: We hope you will go vote. It is one of the honors and obligations of living in this great country. Thank you, and good night.', '10/19/2016'),
